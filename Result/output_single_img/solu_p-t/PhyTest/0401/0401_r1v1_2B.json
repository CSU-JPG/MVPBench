    "Assume that the light at the edge (with an incident angle of 90\u00b0) has a refraction angle \u03b8. According to Snell's Law, n = sin(90\u00b0)/sin(\u03b8), solving for \u03b8 gives \u03b8 = 45\u00b0."

    "Assume that the light at the outer surface of the hemispherical shell has an incident angle r and a refraction angle i, with the normal line forming an angle \u03c0 - \u03b8 with the light passing through the center. According to Snell's Law, n = sin{i} / sin(r), and \u03b8 = r + \u03b8. According to the sine law, the relationship can be expressed as: R / sin(\u03b8) = \u221a2 R / sin(135\u00b0). The radius r of the circular boundary from which light rays emerge on the outer surface of the hemisphere is given by r = \u221a2 R cos(\u03b8). The radius is r = (sqrt(3) + 1) / 2 R."
