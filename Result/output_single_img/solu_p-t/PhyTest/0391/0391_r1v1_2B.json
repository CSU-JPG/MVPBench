The question involves calculating the horizontal distance traveled by a motorcycle during a stunt. The key reasoning steps involve applying the principles of projectile motion to find the horizontal distance traveled.

### Key Reasoning Steps

The problem involves understanding projectile motion, where the car's vertical motion is governed by the equation \( H = \frac{1}{2} g t^2 \), and the horizontal motion is given by \( s = v t \). By solving these equations simultaneously, we can find the horizontal distance \( s \).

### Solution

### Step 1:
Identify the given values:
- Height \( H = 0.8 \, \text{m} \)
- Initial velocity \( v = 3 \, \text{m/s} \)
- Radius of the arc \( R = 1.0 \, \text{m} \)
- Mass of the person and motorcycle \( m = 180 \, \text{kg} \)
- Acceleration due to gravity \( g = 10 \, \text{m/s}^2 \)
- \(\sin 53^\circ = 0.8\)
- \(\cos 53^\circ = 0.6\)

### Step 2:
Calculate the time \( t_2 \) for the vertical motion:
\[ H = \frac{1}{2} g t_2^2 \]
\[ 0.8 = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times t_2^2 \]
\[ t_2^2 = \frac{0.8 \times 2}{10} \]
\[ t_2 = \sqrt{\frac{1.6}{10}} = \sqrt{\frac{0.16}{5}} = 0.4 \, \text{s} \]

### Step 3:
Calculate the horizontal distance \( s \):
\[ s = v \times t_2 \]
\[ s = 3 \times 0.4 = 1.2 \, \text{m} \]

### Final Answer

The horizontal distance traveled by the person and the car is \( 1.2 \, \text{m} \).
