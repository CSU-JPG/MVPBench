  ["The students measure the masses of the ball and the bullet, \\(M\\) and \\(m\\) respectively.", "The bullet and the ball move together after the bullet enters the hole, so their center of mass remains constant.", "The height of the table is \\(h\\), and the horizontal distance from the landing point to the edge of the table is \\(s\\).", "The time of flight can be determined from the height \\(h\\) using the equation for free fall, \\(h = \\frac{1}{2}gt^2\\).", "Solving for \\(t\\), we get \\(t = \\sqrt{\\frac{2h}{g}}\\).", "The horizontal distance \\(s\\) is related to the time of flight and the horizontal velocity \\(v\\) by \\(s = vt\\).", "Substituting \\(t = \\sqrt{\\frac{2h}{g}}\\) into the equation for \\(s\\), we get \\(s = v \\sqrt{\\frac{2h}{g}}\\). Solving for \\(v\\), we get \\(v = \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{\\frac{2h}{g}}} = \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{\\frac{2h}{g}}} = \\frac{s \\sqrt{g}}{\\sqrt{2h}}\\).", "The initial velocity of the bullet and the ball together is the same as the velocity of the bullet after it exits the hole. The total momentum before and after the collision is conserved. The initial momentum is zero, and the final momentum is \\((M + m)v_f\\), where \\(v_f\\) is the velocity of the center of mass. The velocity of the center of mass is the velocity of the bullet and the ball together, which is \\(v = \\frac{(M + m)v_f}{M + m}\\). Therefore, \\(v_f = \\frac{mv}{M + m}\\). The velocity of the bullet is \\(v_b = v_f + v_{ball}\\), where \\(v_{ball}\\) is the velocity of the ball. Since the ball and the bullet move together, \\(v_{ball} = v\\). Therefore, \\(v_b = \\frac{mv}{M + m} + v = \\frac{mv + (M + m)v}{M + m} = \\frac{(M + m)v}{M + m} = v\\). The velocity of the bullet is \\(v_b = \\frac{ms}{(M + m)\\sqrt{\\frac{2h}{g}}}\\). Simplifying, we get \\(v_b = \\frac{(M + m)s\\sqrt{2gh}}{2mh}\\)."]
