The question involves a physical experiment with a hollow insulated cylinder, where the volume of the cylinder is divided into two chambers. The problem involves understanding the relationship between the initial conditions, the movement of the piston, and the resulting changes in volume. The final answer is given as a mathematical expression involving the initial volume and a fractional exponent.

### Key Reasoning Steps

The reasoning steps involve understanding the initial conditions, the process of gas expansion, and the application of the principle of levers and energy conservation. The problem requires solving for the volume of the lower chamber when the gas starts to leak, using the given equations and the properties of gases.

### Answer

The final answer is:
$V_{0} = V(1+x)^{\frac{-3}{5}}$
