["key_step_1", "According to the meaning of the question, the light incident from point A is refracted by glass and then exits from point B. Its optical path diagram is as shown in the figure. According to the geometric knowledge, the incident angle and refraction angle have refractive index. $\cos{\alpha} =\frac{\frac{\sqrt{2}R }{2} }{R} =\frac{\sqrt{2} }{2} $, $\alpha =45^\circ$"],

]

The reasoning steps are as follows:
1. Identify the given information: The light incident from point A is refracted by glass and exits from point B. The optical path diagram is shown, with the incident angle $\alpha = 45^\circ$, and the angle $\angle BOQ = 15^\circ$.
2. Use the given refractive index formula: $\cos{\alpha} = \frac{\frac{\sqrt{2}R }{2} }{R} = \frac{\sqrt{2} }{2}$.
3. Calculate the refractive index using the formula $\sin{\alpha} = \frac{\sin{r}}{n}$.
4. Substitute the known values into the formula to find $n$.

The final answer is the refractive index $n = \sqrt{2}$.

The reasoning steps are logically connected to the problem by using geometric and trigonometric relationships to solve for the refractive index.

The final answer is:
$\sqrt{2}$
