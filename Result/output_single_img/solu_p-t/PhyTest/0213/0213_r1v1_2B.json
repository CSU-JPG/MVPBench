["key_step_1", "First, Pay attention to the red switch S in the figure. When the switch S is closed, according to Ohm's law for closed circuits $E=U+Ir$.When the reading of the resistance box is $R_1 = 2\Omega$ and the reading of the voltage is $U_1 = 4V$, the current in the circuit at this time is $I_1=\frac{U_1}{R_1}$, then $I_1=\frac{4}{2}=2A$. From Ohm's law for closed circuits, we can get $E = U_1+I_1r$, that is $E = 4 + 2r$  ① When the reading of the resistance box is $R_2 = 5\Omega$ and the reading of the voltage is $U_2 = 5V$, the current in the circuit at this time is $I_2=\frac{U_2}{R_2}$, then $I_2=\frac{5}{5}=1A$,According to Ohm's law for closed circuits again, we can get $E = U_2+I_2r$, that is $E = 5 + 1\times r = 5 + r$  ② 
"key_step_2", Next,According to ① and ② ,we can get $E = 6V$ and  $r = 1\\Omega$ ."
