The question involves a physical experiment involving a ring, rods, a rotating shaft, a magnetic field, a capacitor, and a frame. It requires understanding of electromagnetic induction, rotational motion, and charge conservation. The reasoning steps involve identifying the relationships between the given variables, such as the magnetic field, angular velocity, and charge on the capacitor.

### Key Reasoning Steps:

1. **Identify the initial conditions**: The switch is initially connected to terminal 1, and the capacitor is fully charged. The rod ab is in the magnetic field, and the center of mass of the frame abcd rises by 0.2 m.

2. **Apply Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction**: The induced electromotive force (EMF) is given by $E = \frac{1}{2} B_1 \omega r^2$.

3. **Calculate the charge on the capacitor**: The charge $Q = C U = \frac{C E}{2}$, where $C$ is the capacitance, $E$ is the EMF, and $U$ is the voltage.

4. **Determine the final position of the center of mass**: The center of mass rises by 0.2 m, so the final position is $l_1 + 0.2 = 0.25 + 0.2 = 0.45 m$.

5. **Apply the principle of conservation of mechanical energy**: The total mechanical energy before and after the motion is conserved.

### Final Answer:

0.54C, plate M becomes positively charged
