["key_step_1", "value of the refraction angle when the light hits the left side.$\sin{\beta } =\frac{\sin{\alpha} }{n} =\frac{1}{2} $,We can see that $\beta =30^\circ $. 
"key_step_2", According to the geometric relationship, the incident angle of light hitting the right side is also 30, and the refraction angle is 60,Therefore, the angle is $60^circ$.
