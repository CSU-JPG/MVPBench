The question involves understanding the geometric relationship between the light path and the refractive index of the material. The key reasoning steps involve using the given angle of refraction and the refractive index to calculate the distance between the people based on the geometric properties of the triangle formed by the light path.

### Key Reasoning Steps

1. **Identify the given information**: The light path diagram, the refractive index, and the angle of incidence. The refractive index is given as $\sqrt{3}$, and the angle of incidence is $60^\circ$.
2. **Apply the law of refraction**: According to the law of refraction, $\sin{\theta_1} = \frac{n}{1}$, where $n$ is the refractive index.
3. **Calculate the angle of reflection**: Since $\theta_1 = 60^\circ$, $\theta_2 = 30^\circ$.
4. **Use the tangent of the angle of incidence**: $\tan{heta _2} = \frac{AB}{BC}$.
5. **Solve for AB**: Since $\tan{heta _2} = \frac{AB}{BC}$, and $\tan{30^\circ} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}$, we have $\frac{AB}{BC} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}$.
6. **Calculate AB**: Since $AB = BC \cdot \tan{30^\circ}$, substitute the known values to find $AB = 6\sqrt{3}$ cm.

### Final Answer

The distance between them is $6\sqrt{3} \, \text{cm}$.
