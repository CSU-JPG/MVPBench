["key_step_1", "The original question is about calculating the potential difference between two points in a square wire frame due to a changing magnetic field. The side length of the square is given, and the magnetic field is increasing uniformly. The problem involves understanding the relationship between the magnetic field, the current, and the potential difference in a circuit. The key reasoning steps involve using the principles of magnetic fields, electric circuits, and Ohm's law to solve the problem. The potential difference between points a and b is calculated using the formula for the induced voltage in a coil when the magnetic field changes. The final answer is given as the potential difference between points a and b in the wire frame.]
