    "The v-t graph shows the pedestrian's velocity as constant at 8 m/s throughout the time interval from 0 to 8 seconds. The bus's velocity is zero at the start and increases linearly with time, reaching 8 m/s at 8 seconds. The pedestrian starts 36 meters away from the bus when the green light turns on. The bus accelerates uniformly from rest to 8 m/s in 8 seconds. The pedestrian's speed is less than the bus's speed, so they cannot catch up."

    "The pedestrian's velocity is constant at 8 m/s, while the bus's velocity increases linearly from 0 to 8 m/s. The pedestrian's displacement is 36 meters, while the bus's displacement is 32 meters. Since the bus's displacement is less than the pedestrian's, the pedestrian cannot catch up with the bus."
