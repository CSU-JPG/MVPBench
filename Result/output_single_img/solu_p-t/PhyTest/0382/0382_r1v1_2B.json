The question involves understanding the motion of a charged particle in a magnetic field, specifically focusing on the trajectory and the magnetic field strength. The key reasoning steps involve using the given velocity and magnetic field conditions to calculate the magnetic induction.

### Key Reasoning Steps:

1. **Identify the given information**: The particle is injected at an angle of 45 degrees to the line MN, with a velocity $v_0$. The magnetic field is uniform, and the particle's velocity is such that the vertical component remains unchanged, while the horizontal component reverses direction.

2. **Apply the formula for magnetic induction**: The magnetic induction $B$ is given by $ B = \frac{mv_0}{qr} $.

3. **Use the given distance**: The distance $2d$ is the distance from the point $c$ to the point $f$, which is on the same horizontal line as the insulating plate $a b$.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Calculate the radius of the circular path**: Since $2r \sin 45^{\circ} = 2d$, we have $r = \frac{d}{\sin 45^{\circ}} = \frac{d}{\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}} = \frac{2d}{\sqrt{2}}$.

2. **Apply the formula for magnetic induction**: Using $ B = \frac{mv_0}{qr} $, substitute $ m = q = 1 $, $ r = \frac{2d}{\sqrt{2}} $, and $ qv_0 = m \frac{v_0^2}{r} $.

3. **Solve for $ B $**: Substitute the values into the equation: $ B = \frac{1 \times v_0}{1 \times \frac{2d}{\sqrt{2}}} = \frac{\sqrt{2}v_0}{2d} $.

### Final Answer

The magnitude of the magnetic induction $B$ is $\frac{\sqrt{2}mv_0}{2qd}$.
