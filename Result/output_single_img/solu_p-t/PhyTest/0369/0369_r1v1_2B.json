The question involves understanding the motion of electrons in a series of metal cylinders, using principles of electric fields and mechanics. The key reasoning steps involve applying the work-energy theorem and the properties of uniform motion to determine the length of the cylinders.

### Key Reasoning Steps

1. **Initial Conditions**: The electron starts from rest at the circular plate and is accelerated in the electric field between the cylinders.
2. **Work-Energy Theorem**: The total mechanical energy is conserved, so the initial kinetic energy equals the final kinetic energy.
3. **Electric Field**: The electric field between the cylinders is uniform, and the electron experiences a constant acceleration.
4. **Periodic Motion**: The electron moves in a series of cylinders, each with a constant electric field, resulting in periodic motion.
5. **Determine Length**: The length of the nth cylinder is determined by the electron's velocity and the period of the motion.

### Final Answer

The electron starts from the circular plate with uniformly accelerated linear motion, enters cylinder 1 and undergoes uniform linear motion, then undergoes uniformly accelerated linear motion in the gap between cylinders 1 and 2, and finally enters cylinder 2 and undergoes uniform linear motion. The length \( L_n \) of the nth metal cylinder is \( \sqrt{\frac{2 U e}{m}} \).

### Analyzing the Motion

- **Step 1**: The electron starts from rest and is accelerated in the electric field between the cylinders.
- **Step 2**: The electron's motion is periodic, with the electron moving through the cylinders in a sequence of uniform motion.
- **Step 3**: The time for the electron to pass through the gaps between cylinders is negligible.
- **Step 4**: The length \( L_n \) of the nth cylinder is determined by the electron's velocity \( v_n \) and the period \( T \).

### Conclusion

The electron's motion is governed by the work-energy theorem and the properties of periodic motion. The length of the nth cylinder is determined by the electron's velocity \( v_n \) and the period \( T \).

### Final Answer

The length \( L_n \) of the nth metal cylinder is \( \sqrt{\frac{2 U e}{m}} \).
