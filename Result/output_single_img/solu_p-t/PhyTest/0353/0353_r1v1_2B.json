The question involves a physics problem involving a slider moving down a track, colliding with a ball, and completing a motion. It requires understanding of projectile motion, friction, and energy conservation. The task is to find the maximum horizontal distance $x_{max}$ between the landing point $Q$ and point $F$.

### Key Reasoning Steps:

1. **Identify the initial conditions**: The slider starts from rest at point $P$ on the track $AB$, with a height $h$ above the platform. The slider slides down the track, collides with a ball, and moves through a quarter-circular and semi-circular track.

2. **Apply the work-energy theorem**: The work done by friction on the slider equals the change in kinetic energy. This allows us to calculate the initial velocity of the slider.

3. **Determine the motion of the ball**: The ball moves from point $E$ to point $F$, passing through the quarter-circular and semi-circular tracks. The ball's motion is influenced by friction and the gravitational force.

4. **Calculate the maximum horizontal distance**: Use the projectile motion equation $x = v_{G}t$ and the equation $H + r - y = \frac{1}{2}gt^2$ to find the maximum horizontal distance $x_{max}$.

### Key Steps:

- **Step 1**: Calculate the initial velocity of the slider using the work-energy theorem.
- **Step 2**: Use the projectile motion equation to find the horizontal distance $x$.
- **Step 3**: Solve for $x_{max}$ using the equation $x = 2\sqrt{(0.5-y)(0.3+y)}$.

### Final Answer:

The maximum horizontal distance $x_{max}$ between the landing point $Q$ and point $F$ is 0.8m.
