The reasoning steps are as follows:
1. Identify the initial and final states of the gas based on the p-V diagram.
2. Use the ideal gas equation to relate the initial and final states.
3. Calculate the work done by the gas, which is the area under the p-V plot line.
4. Since the temperature is the same in both states, the internal energy change is zero.
5. Use the first law of thermodynamics to find the heat transferred, Q.
