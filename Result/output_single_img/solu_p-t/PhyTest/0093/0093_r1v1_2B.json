["key_step_1", "the initial conditions of the system are given: the ball is initially at rest on the slider, and the rod is horizontal. The ball is given an upward velocity of 4 m/s. The gravitational acceleration is 10 m/sÂ². The system is locked, meaning the slider is stationary and the ball is at the highest point P on the rod."],
["key_step_2", "The ball moves upward with velocity \( v = 4 \, \text{m/s} \) when it reaches the highest point \( P \). The force exerted by the ball on the rod is the centripetal force. The centripetal force is given by \( F = m \cdot v^2 / r \) where \( m \) is the mass of the ball, \( v \) is the velocity, and \( r \) is the radius of the circle. The radius \( r \) is the length of the rod \( L \)."]],
["key_step_3", "The radius \( r \) is \( L = 0.5 \, \text{m} \). Therefore, the centripetal force \( F \) is \( F = 1 \, \text{kg} \times (4 \, \text{m/s})^2 / 0.5 \, \text{m} = 16 \, \text{N} \). The force exerted by the ball on the rod is therefore 16 N, which is the magnitude of the force exerted by the ball on the rod when it passes through the highest point P. The direction of the force is vertically upward, as the ball is moving upward."]
