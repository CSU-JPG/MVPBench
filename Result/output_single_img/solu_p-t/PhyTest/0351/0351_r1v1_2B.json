The question involves a physics problem involving a block $a$ in a vertical plane, a conveyor belt, and a collision. It requires using principles of mechanics, including conservation of energy and momentum, to solve for the initial velocity of block $a$ immediately after a collision with block $b$. The problem involves understanding the motion of the blocks, the forces involved, and the application of the laws of motion and mechanics.

### Key Reasoning Steps

The problem involves the following steps:

1. **Identify the initial conditions**: Block $a$ is initially at rest at point $A$, and block $b$ is at a height $h$. The block $a$ is pulled to a height $h$ before being released.

2. **Apply the conservation of mechanical energy**: The initial mechanical energy of block $a$ is converted into kinetic energy upon release. The final mechanical energy of block $a$ after the collision is also kinetic energy.

3. **Use the law of conservation of momentum**: The momentum of block $a$ before the collision equals the momentum of block $b$ after the collision.

4. **Solve for the initial velocity of block $a$**: Using the equations of motion and the given values, solve for the initial velocity $v_{0}$.

The reasoning steps are:

1. **Step 1**: Use the conservation of mechanical energy to find the velocity of block $b$ immediately after release.
2. **Step 2**: Apply the law of conservation of momentum to find the velocity of block $a$ immediately after the collision.
3. **Step 3**: Solve the equations to find the initial velocity $v_{0}$ of block $a$.
