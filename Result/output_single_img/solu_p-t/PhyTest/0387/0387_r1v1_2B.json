The question involves a physics problem involving a spring, a slider, and a circular arc. It requires calculating the angle between the velocity of the slider and the horizontal direction when it lands at point C. The problem involves using the principles of projectile motion and trigonometry.

### Key Reasoning Steps:

1. **Identify the given values and relationships**: The height of point C is given, the radius of the arc, and the angle of the slider. The velocity at point B is known, and the motion is projectile.

2. **Apply the projectile motion formula**: The vertical motion is given by \( h - h_{\mathrm{C}} = \frac{1}{2} g t^2 \). The horizontal distance \( x_{\mathrm{BC}} = v_{\mathrm{B}} t \).

3. **Calculate the time of flight**: Use the formula \( t = \sqrt{\frac{2h_{\mathrm{C}}}{g}} \).

4. **Calculate the velocity at point B**: \( v_{\mathrm{B}} = x_{\mathrm{BC}} / t \).

5. **Calculate the vertical velocity at point C**: \( v_{y} = g t = 3 \times 0.3 = 0.9 \, \text{m/s} \).

6. **Use the trigonometric relationship**: Since \(\tan\alpha = \frac{v_{y}}{v_{\mathrm{B}}}\), solve for \(\alpha\).
