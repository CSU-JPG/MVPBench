[Answer]
The work done by the gas when it changes from state B to state C is 0.3p0V0.

[Key Reasoning Steps]

The problem involves understanding the relationship between the internal energy, temperature, and work done in an ideal gas. The key steps involve using the ideal gas law and the given data to calculate the work done.

1. **Identify the initial and final states**: The initial state is B with pressure \( P_B = 0.6P_0 \) and volume \( V_B = V_0 \). The final state is C with pressure \( P_C = 0.6P_0 \) and volume \( V_C = 0.5V_0 \).

2. **Calculate the work done**: The work done by the gas is given by the difference in volume times the pressure difference. Thus, \( W = 0.6P_0 \times (V_C - V_B) \).

3. **Apply the ideal gas law**: Use the equation \( \frac{P_0V_0}{T_0} = \frac{0.6P_0V_0}{T_0} \) to find \( T_C = 0.6T_0 \).

4. **Calculate the change in internal energy**: The change in internal energy is \( \Delta U = a(T_C - T_B) = a(0.6T_0 - T_0) = -0.3aT_0 \).

5. **Apply the first law of thermodynamics**: The work done \( W = Q - \Delta U \). Given \( Q = 0.3aT_0 + 0.3p_0V_0 \), solve for \( W \).

6. **Solve for the work done**: \( W = 0.3p_0V_0 - (-0.3aT_0) = 0.3p_0V_0 + 0.3aT_0 \).

7. **Substitute the values**: \( W = 0.3p_0V_0 + 0.3aT_0 = 0.3p_0V_0 + 0.3 \times 0.6 \times T_0 \times 0.5 = 0.3p_0V_0 + 0.3aT_0 \).

8. **Simplify the expression**: \( W = 0.3p_0V_0 + 0.3aT_0 = 0.3p_0V_0 + 0.3aT_0 \).

### Final Answer
The gas transitions from state B to state C, releasing heat quantified by \( Q = 0.3aT_0 + 0.3p_0V_0 \).
