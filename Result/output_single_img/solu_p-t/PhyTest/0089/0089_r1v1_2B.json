    "the rod is a uniform cylinder with mass $m$ and length $3L$; point $O$ is the center of mass; the balls A and B are fixed at the ends of the rod; the rod rotates around point $O$; the balls exert forces on the rod; air resistance is neglected; when ball A reaches the highest point, it exerts no force on the rod; the force exerted by ball B on the rod is calculated using the principle of moments and Newton's second law of motion; the force exerted by ball B is $3mg$"
