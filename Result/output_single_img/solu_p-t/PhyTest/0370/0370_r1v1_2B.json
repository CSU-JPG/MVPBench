[Answer]
5V, 5Ω

[Key Reasoning Steps]

The problem involves analyzing a circuit with a power supply, resistors, and a capacitor. The key steps involve using Ohm's law and the relationship between voltage, current, and resistance to find the power supply's voltage and internal resistance.

### Key Reasoning Steps

1. **Identify the known values**: $R_1 = 50\Omega$, $R_2$ is unknown, $C = 2 \times 10^{-6}\, \text{F}$.
2. **Apply Ohm's Law**: For the power supply, $E = U_1 + I_1 r$.
3. **Calculate the voltage at different points**: 
   - When $P$ is at the left end, $U_1 = 4\, \text{V}$, $I_1 = 0.2\, \text{A}$.
   - When $P$ is at the right end, $U_2 = 1\, \text{V}$, $I_2 = 0.8\, \text{A}$.
4. **Use the relationship between voltage and current**: $E = U_2 + I_2 r$.
5. **Solve for the power supply's voltage and internal resistance**: 
   - Substitute the known values into the equation: $5 = 1 + 0.8r$.
   - Solve for $r$: $r = 5\, \text{Ω}$.

### Final Answer

5V, 5Ω
