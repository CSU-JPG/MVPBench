The question involves calculating the propagation time of light in a water mist hemisphere using the given angles and refractive index. The reasoning steps involve using the properties of refraction and the relationship between the speed of light and the refractive index to solve for the time.

### Key Reasoning Steps:

1. **Identify the given information**: The incident angle for light b is 45 degrees, and the refractive index of light b is $\sqrt{2}$. The angle for light a is 30 degrees, and the speed of light in air is $c$.

2. **Use the refractive index formula**: For light b, $n_b = \frac{\sin(45^\circ)}{\sin(\theta)}$, where $\theta = 30^\circ$. Therefore, $\sin(30^\circ) = 0.5$.

3. **Calculate the refractive index for light a**: $n_a = \frac{\sin(60^\circ)}{\sin(\theta)} = \sqrt{3}$.

4. **Calculate the speed of light in the water mist hemisphere**: $v_a = \frac{c}{n}$, so $v_a = \frac{\sqrt{3}c}{3}$.

5. **Calculate the propagation time**: $t = \frac{R}{v_a} = \frac{R}{\frac{\sqrt{3}c}{3}} = \frac{3R}{\sqrt{3}c}$.

### Final Answer

The propagation time of light in the water mist hemisphere is $\frac{3R}{c}$.
