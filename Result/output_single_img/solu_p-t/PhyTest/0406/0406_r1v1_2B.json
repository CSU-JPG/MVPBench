The question involves calculating the length of an arc in a cylindrical optical element based on the properties of light rays and the refractive index of the material. The key reasoning steps involve understanding the geometric relationships and the properties of total internal reflection.

### Key Reasoning Steps

1. **Identify the refractive index**: The refractive index \( n = 2 \).
2. **Calculate the critical angle**: Since \( \sin(C) = \frac{1}{n} \), \( C = 30^\circ \).
3. **Apply total internal reflection**: For light rays to exit from the arc AC through AB or BC, the angle of incidence must be equal to the critical angle.
4. **Calculate the arc length**: Use the formula for the arc length \( FH = \frac{1}{12}\times 2\pi R \).

### Answer

The length of the arc \( FG \) where the light rays cannot directly exit through AB or BC is given by \( FH = \frac{1}{6}\pi R \).

["key_step_2", "As shown in the diagram, if the light ray along DB direction just undergoes total internal reflection on the AB side, then \(\angle ADF = 30^\circ \). Similarly, if the light ray along DG direction just undergoes total internal reflection on the BC side, then \(\angle CDG = 30^\circ \). Therefore, \(\angle FDH = 30^\circ \). According to the geometric relationship, the length of the arc FG can be obtained as follows: \( FH = \frac{1}{12}\times 2\pi R \), The answer is \( FH = \frac{1}{6}\pi R \)"],
