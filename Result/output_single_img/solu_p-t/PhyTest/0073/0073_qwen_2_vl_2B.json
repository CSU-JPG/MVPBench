["The working principle of the electromagnetic railgun is that the projectile to be launched can move freely between two parallel rails and maintain good contact with the rails. Current flows in from one rail, passes through the conductive projectile, and then flows back through the other rail. The rail current generates a magnetic field perpendicular to the plane of the rails at the projectile (which can be considered as a uniform magnetic field). The electrified projectile is then propelled at high speed along the rails due to the Lorentz force acting on it.", "The rail current generates a magnetic field perpendicular to the plane of the rails at the projectile (which can be considered as a uniform magnetic field).
