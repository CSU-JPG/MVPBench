    "The problem involves two vehicles, a truck and a bus, braking simultaneously on a highway. The initial separation between them is 30 meters. The graphs show their velocity-time relationships during braking. The task is to find the maximum distance between them after the braking process ends."

    "At $t = 10s$, the truck's velocity is 40 m/s, and the bus's velocity is 30 m/s. The maximum distance between the two vehicles occurs when the truck has stopped and the bus is still moving."

    "The maximum distance between the two vehicles is the difference between the bus's total distance and the truck's distance when the truck has stopped."
