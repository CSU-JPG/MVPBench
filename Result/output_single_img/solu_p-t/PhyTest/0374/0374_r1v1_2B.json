The question involves calculating the horizontal and vertical accelerations of a missile during its flight. The missile is launched from a height of 20,000 meters, and its trajectory is described by a curved path. The missile's mass is 100 kg, and the thrust force is 11,000 N. The problem requires using Newton's second law to find the accelerations in the horizontal and vertical directions.

### Key Reasoning Steps:

1. **Identify the forces acting on the missile.** The missile experiences thrust from the rocket engine and air resistance.
2. **Apply Newton's second law.** The net force is the difference between the thrust and the resistance.
3. **Calculate the thrust force.** The thrust force is given as 11,000 N.
4. **Calculate the resistance force.** Since the missile's mass is 100 kg, the resistance force is 100 kg * 10 m/s^2 = 1000 N.
5. **Calculate the net force.** The net force is 11,000 N - 1000 N = 10,000 N.
6. **Apply Newton's second law.** The net force is equal to the sum of the horizontal and vertical accelerations.
7. **Calculate the horizontal acceleration.** Horizontal acceleration \( a_x = \frac{F \sin \theta}{m} = \frac{11000 \times \frac{10}{11}}{100} = 100 \, \text{m/s}^2 \).
8. **Calculate the vertical acceleration.** Vertical acceleration \( a_y = \frac{F \cos \theta - mg}{m} = \frac{11000 \times \frac{1}{11} - 100 \times 10}{100} = 0 \, \text{m/s}^2 \).

### Final Answer

The horizontal and vertical accelerations are both \( 100 \, \text{m/s}^2 \).
