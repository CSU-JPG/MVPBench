["key_step_1", "First, Pay attention to the red - colored line in the figure. According to the left - hand rule, determine the direction of the Ampere force on each segment. Let the resistance of the circuit $abcd$ be $3r$. From the geometric relationship, the length of the $ad$ segment is $2L$, so the resistance of $ad$ is $2r$. The current in $abcd$ is $I_{1}=\frac{E}{3r}$, and the current in $ad$ is $I_{2}=\frac{E}{2r}$. ."],
["key_step_2", "Next,the Ampere forces on each segment of $ab$, $bc$, and $cd$ can be obtained as $F_{1} = F_{2}=F_{3}=BI_{1}L=\\frac{BEL}{3r}$.The Ampere force on each segment of $ad$ is $F_{4}=BI_{2}\\cdot2L=\\frac{BEL}{r}$. ."],
["key_step_3", "Finally,Since among the forces acting on each segment, the components of $F_{1}$ and $F_{3}$ in the left-right direction have equal magnitudes but opposite directions and cancel each other out, the resultant external force $F$ acting on the wire frame is $F = F_{4}+F_{1}\\cos60^{\\circ}+F_{2}+F_{3}\\cos60^{\\circ}=\frac{5BEL}{3r}$.Given that $r = \\frac{\\rho L}{S}$, we can obtain $F=\\frac{5BSE}{3\\rho}$, and the direction is vertically upward ."]
