["key_step_1", "Consider the object on the elevator floor as the object of study, and perform a force analysis on the object. According to Newton's third law, the pressure exerted by the object on the floor is equal to the normal force exerted by the floor on the object, i.e., $F = F_{N}$. During the time interval of 0 to 2 seconds, $F_{N1} = F_{1} > mg$, the net force acting on the object is vertically upward, thus the object undergoes uniform acceleration motion upwards."],
["key_step_2", "According to Newton's second law, we have $F_{N1} - mg = ma_{1}$. We can derive: $a_{1} = \frac{F_{N1} - mg}{m} = \frac{1.5 \times 10^{3} - 100 \times 10}{100} \mathrm{m/s^{2}} = 5.0 \mathrm{m/s^{2}}$. Therefore, the displacement of the object is $x_{1} = \frac{1}{2} a_{1} t_{1}^{2} = \frac{1}{2} \times 5.0 \times 2.0^{2} \mathrm{m} = 10.0 \mathrm{m}$."],
["key_step_3", "The velocity of the object at the end of 2 seconds is $v = a_{1} t_{1} = 5.0 \times 2.0 \mathrm{m/s} = 10.0 \mathrm{m/s}$. During the time interval of 2 to 6 seconds, $F_{N2} = mg$, the net force acting on the object is zero, thus the object undergoes uniform linear motion upwards. The displacement of the object is $x_{2} = v t_{2} = 10.0 \times 4.0 \mathrm{m} = 40.0 \mathrm{m}$."],
["key_step_4", "During the time interval of 6 to 8 seconds, $F_{N3} < mg$, the net force acting on the object is vertically downward, thus the object undergoes uniform deceleration motion upwards. The initial velocity of the object is $v = 10.0 \mathrm{m/s}$. According to Newton's second law, we have $F_{3} - mg = ma_{3}$. We can derive: $a_{3} = \frac{F_{3} - mg}{m} = \frac{500 - 100 \times 10}{100} \mathrm{m/s^{2}} = -5.0 \mathrm{m/s^{2}}$. Therefore, the displacement of the object is $x_{3} = v t_{3} + \frac{1}{2} a_{3} t_{3}^{2} = 10.0 \times 2.0 \mathrm{m} + \frac{1}{2} \times (-5.0) \times 2.0^{2} \mathrm{m} = 10.0 \mathrm{m}$."],
["key_step_5", "The total displacement of the object during the entire process is $x = x_{1} + x_{2} + x_{3} = 10.0 \mathrm{m} + 40.0 \mathrm{m} + 10.0 \mathrm{m} = 60.0 \mathrm{m}$. Therefore, the height the elevator rises in 8 seconds is $60.0 \mathrm{m}$."]
