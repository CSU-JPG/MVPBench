[Input Format]
The question involves a physics problem about a basketball's motion after being dropped from rest. It requires calculating the ratio of the post-collision velocity to the pre-collision velocity. The problem involves understanding the forces acting on the basketball, the motion of the basketball, and the relationship between the initial and final velocities.

The reasoning steps are organized in a logical order that follows the problem's description, starting from the initial conditions and ending with the final calculation of the post-collision velocity relative to the pre-collision velocity. Each step is clearly defined and follows logically from the previous one, ensuring the solution is complete and accurate.
