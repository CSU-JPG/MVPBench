["key_step_1", "According to the refraction law, \( n = \frac{\sin i}{\sin r} \)", "With the increase of \( I \), \( r \) increases, but \( r \) cannot be equal to or greater than the critical angle \( C \)"],
["key_step_2", "In the figure, for any point on the sphere, the normal of the sphere must pass through the center of the sphere. Let \( R \) be the angle of refraction when light enters from point A, and \( i' \) be the angle of incidence when light exits from point B. They are the two base angles of an isosceles triangle, so there is \( i' = r \). \( r \) cannot be equal to or greater than the critical angle \( C \), so \( i' \) cannot be equal to or greater than the critical angle, that is, when light exits from point B, total reflection cannot happen. The light will not be totally reflected when it is emitted from the inside of the sphere."]

The reasoning steps are structured to logically connect the question about light behavior in a transparent medium to the conclusion about total reflection. The steps involve understanding the relationship between the angle of incidence \( i \), the angle of refraction \( r \), and the critical angle \( C \), as well as the properties of an isosceles triangle formed by these angles.

The final answer aligns with the logical deduction that total reflection does not occur when light exits from the inside of a sphere, as the critical angle is exceeded.

The reasoning steps are presented in a clear, logical order, ensuring that each step logically follows from the previous one, leading to the final answer.

The final answer is:
the light will not be totally reflected when it is emitted from the inside of the sphere
