ADDITIONAL RULES:
1. The question involves understanding the relationship between volume, temperature, and work done by an ideal gas.
2. The figure shows a graph of volume versus temperature, with state A at $T_{A}$ and $V_{A}$, state B at $T_{B}$ and $V_{B}$, and state C at the origin.
3. The work done by the gas on the outside world is given as 10 J.
4. The heat absorbed by the gas is calculated using the relationship between work done and heat absorbed.

### Key Reasoning Steps

The problem involves understanding the relationship between the volume, temperature, and work done by an ideal gas. The graph shows that the volume increases from A to B, and the temperature remains constant at $T_{0}$.

### Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Identify the initial and final states**: The initial state is A with $T_{A}$ and $V_{A}$, and the final state is B with $T_{B}$ and $V_{B}$.
2. **Apply the gas law**: Since the temperature is constant, the volume change is proportional to the pressure change. Thus, $V_{B}=2V_{A}$.
3. **Calculate the work done by the gas**: The work done by the gas on the outside world is given as 10 J.
4. **Use the heat equation**: Since the work done is equal to the heat absorbed by the gas, $Q=10J$.

### Final Answer

The heat absorbed by the gas in this process is 10 joules.
