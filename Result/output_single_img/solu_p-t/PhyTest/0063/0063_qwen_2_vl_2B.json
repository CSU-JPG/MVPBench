["The distance between two parallel rails is $15\\mathrm{cm}$, the mass of the metal rod MN is $\\mathrm{m}=17\\mathrm{g}$, its resistance $\\mathrm{R}_{1}$ is $4\\Omega$, the sliding rheostat $\\mathrm{R}_{2}$ is connected in series with MN, the magnetic induction intensity B of the uniform magnetic field is vertically upward with a magnitude of $0.6\\mathrm{T}$, the electromotive force of the power source is $E = 10\\mathrm{{V}}$, and the internal resistance $\\mathbf{r}=1\\Omega$. When the switch S is closed, the metal rod MN remains stationary ($g=10\\mathrm{m/s}^{2}$, $\\sqrt{3}=1.7$).If the parallel rails are smooth, find the magnitude of the Ampere force acting on the metal rod and the resistance value of $\\mathrm{R}_{2}$ (retain one significant figure in the result)."]
