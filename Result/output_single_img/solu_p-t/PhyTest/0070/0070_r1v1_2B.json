    "The magnetic induction intensity is given as 0.1 T. The number of turns is 100. The side lengths of the rectangular coil are 0.2 m and 0.5 m. The angular velocity is 100\u03c0 rad/s. The coil rotates around the symmetry axis OO\u2032. The timing starts when the coil plane passes through the neutral plane."
