["key_step_1", "When the droplet is about to detach, the gravitational force on the droplet balances the surface tension force acting along the circumference of the nozzle. The gravitational force is given by the weight of the droplet: $F_g = \frac{4}{3}\pi r_{\text{max}}^3 \rho g$."],
["key_step_2", The surface tension force is acting along the circumference, with the 'neck' of water having vertical tangents at the separation point: $F_\sigma = \pi d \sigma$.],
["key_step_3", Equating the two forces: $\frac{4}{3}\pi r_{\text{max}}^3 \rho g = \pi d \sigma$.],
["key_step_4", Solving for $r_{\text{max}}$: $r_{\text{max}} = \sqrt[3]{\frac{3 \sigma d}{4 \rho g}}$.
