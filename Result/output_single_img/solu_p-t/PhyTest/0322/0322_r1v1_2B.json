The reasoning steps are organized in a logical sequence that connects the initial state of the gas to the final state, using the principles of thermodynamics and the ideal gas law. The steps involve identifying the initial and final states of the gas, calculating the work done by the gas, and using the first law of thermodynamics to find the heat transferred.

The final answer is based on the calculation of the heat transferred by the gas, which is directly provided in the question.

The reasoning steps are:
1. Identify the initial and final states of the gas from the p-V diagram.
2. Calculate the work done by the gas from the change in volume and pressure.
3. Use the first law of thermodynamics to find the heat transferred, which is the difference between the work done and the internal energy change.

The steps logically connect the initial state of the gas to the final state, using the principles of thermodynamics and the ideal gas law.

The final answer is:
1000 J
