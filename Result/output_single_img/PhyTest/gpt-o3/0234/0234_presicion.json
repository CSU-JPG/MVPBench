The equilateral triangle (side a) keeps its orientation while its whole figure translates to the right with a constant velocity v. At t = 0 the vertex D is on the boundary (D: x = 0). Let the horizontal shift of the triangle be s = vt (0 ≤ s ≤ a); then C: (s − a, 0) D: (s, 0) E: (s − a/2, −h), h = √3 a /2.",
