    "conclusion": "The working principle of the electromagnetic railgun involves a projectile moving freely between two parallel rails, maintaining good contact with them. Current flows from one rail, through the conductive projectile, and back through the other rail. The rail current generates a magnetic field perpendicular to the plane of the rails at the projectile, which can be considered a uniform magnetic field. The electrified projectile is propelled at high speed along the rails due to the Lorentz force acting on it.",
