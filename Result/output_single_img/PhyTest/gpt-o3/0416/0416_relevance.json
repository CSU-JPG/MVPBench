    "conclusion": "The two beams a and b arrive from air and are normal to AB, so at AB they are not deflected; they simply enter the glass and remain parallel.",

  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",

    "relevant": "Yes"
  },
  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "Because the right-hand beam b is bent more strongly at the spherical interface, the glass has a higher refractive index for b, which means b has the higher frequency (shorter wavelength). Diffraction effects are stronger for the longer-wavelength beam a, not for b.",
