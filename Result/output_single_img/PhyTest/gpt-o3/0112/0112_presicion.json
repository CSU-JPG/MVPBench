    "conclusion": "The problem involves a schematic diagram of a play activity in a children's playground with a metal guide rail fixed at an angle α. A small ball inside a narrow groove on the guide rail can slide without friction. One end of the rope is connected to the ball, and the other end is connected to a pillow. The child can hold the pillow and slide down together with it. The angle between the rope and the vertical direction is β, and β remains constant. The mass of the pillow is m1, the mass of the child is m2, and the mass of the small ball, the rope, and air resistance are ignored.",
