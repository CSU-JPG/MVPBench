    "conclusion": "A U-shaped guide rail is fixed on a horizontal surface with a resistor R = 3.0Ω connected in series at the left end. The distance between the guide rails is L = 1.0m. A uniform magnetic field B = 1.0T passes vertically downward through the plane of the guide rails. A metal rod PQ with a mass m = 1kg and a resistance r = 1.0Ω makes good contact with the guide rails and moves uniformly to the right at a speed of v = 2m/s under the action of a horizontal rightward external force F. The coefficient of kinetic friction between the rod PQ and the guide rails is μ= 0.3.",
