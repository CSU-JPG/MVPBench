    "conclusion": "For a radial conductor of length r that rotates with constant angular speed ω in a uniform field B1 perpendicular to the plane of rotation, the motional emf between its inner end (on the shaft) and its outer end (on the ring) is ε = 1/2 B1 ω r^2.",

    "conclusion": "Both diametrically opposite rods generate the same emf with the same polarity, so the open-circuit voltage between the ring (connected to the upper rail) and the rotating shaft (connected to the lower rail) is still 12 V.",

    "conclusion": "With the switch S on contact 1 the capacitor C is simply connected across those two rails; after a sufficiently long charging time the current through the internal resistance of the generator becomes zero, so the capacitor voltage equals the emf.",
