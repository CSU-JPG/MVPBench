The string passes over a fixed pulley at the top of an inclined plane with an angle of 37°, which is fixed on a horizontal ground. Initially, object B is pulled to the bottom of the inclined plane, while object A is at a height of 1 m above the ground. Friction between B and the inclined plane, as well as between the string and the pulley, is negligible. The system is released from rest and allowed to move.",
