    "conclusion": "The working principle of a certain type of mass spectrometer is shown in Figure (1). M and N are two vertically placed metal plates with a voltage U between them. Plate Q is the recording plate, and interface P divides the region between N and Q into two parts, I and II, each with a width of d. The planes of M, N, P, and Q are parallel to each other. a and b are two small, directly opposed holes on M and N, respectively. Taking the line passing through a and b as the z-axis, with the right direction as positive, and the intersection point o of the z-axis and plate Q as the origin, a Cartesian coordinate system Oxyz is established. The positive x-axis is parallel to plate Q and points horizontally inward, and the positive y-axis is vertically upward. Region I is filled with a uniform magnetic field along the positive x-axis with magnetic field strength B, and region II is filled with a uniform electric field along the positive x-axis with electric field strength E. A particle with mass m and charge +q drifts into the electric field from hole a (initial velocity considered zero), passes through hole b, enters the magnetic field, passes through point c on plane P (not drawn in the figure), and then enters the electric field before finally hitting the recording plate Q. The gravity of the particle is negligible.",
