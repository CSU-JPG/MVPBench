    "conclusion": "Understanding the setup: Dawes prism formed by cutting an isosceles right-angle prism, prism faces form 45° angles at corners C and D, monochromatic light ray from point M enters through edge AC, ray is initially parallel to base CD, refractive index of the glass is n = √2.",
    "relevant": "Yes"

  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "Determine the refraction angle when light enters the prism using Snell's law: n₁·sin(θ₁) = n₂·sin(θ₂), incident angle θ₁ = 45°, refraction angle θ₂ = arcsin(1/2) = 30°.",
    "relevant": "Yes"
  },
  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "Analyze the path inside the prism: After refraction, the ray is at 30° from the normal to AC, refracted ray makes a 15° angle with the vertical, travels at a 75° angle relative to the horizontal.",
    "relevant": "Yes"
  },
  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "Determine if the light can exit from edge CD: Check if total internal reflection occurs, angle of incidence θᵢ = 75°, critical angle θc = arcsin(1/√2) ≈ 45°, since θᵢ > θc, total internal reflection occurs, light cannot exit from edge CD.",
    "relevant": "Yes"
  },
  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "Final Answer: Refraction angle when light enters the Dawes prism is 30°, light cannot exit from edge CD due to total internal reflection.",
