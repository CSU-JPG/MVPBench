    "conclusion": "Board ab experiences weight Mg downward, normal force N₁ upward, friction force from ground f₁, and force from block P: friction force f₂ in the same direction as v. For the board to remain stationary, net horizontal force must be zero: f₁ = f₂ = μ₂mg.",

    "conclusion": "Verify direction of f₁: Block moving right, friction force f₂ acts left. By Newton's third law, block exerts equal magnitude force on board to the right. For board to remain stationary, friction force from ground f₁ must act left to balance this force.",
