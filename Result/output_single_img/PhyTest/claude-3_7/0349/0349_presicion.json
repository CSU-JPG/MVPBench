    "conclusion": "Yes, the velocity distribution curve of the gas molecules changes during the D→A process. Since this is an isochoric heating process where temperature increases, the Maxwell-Boltzmann velocity distribution will shift toward higher velocities, become broader, and have a higher average velocity. The fundamental shape of the distribution curve changes as the temperature increases from state D to state A.",
