    "conclusion": "The problem involves an electromagnetic launcher where a coil is attached to a mover that slides on rails through a magnetic field. The coil is connected to a constant current source when switch S is at position 1. The mover accelerates from rest to v₁ = 80 m/s in t₁ = 1.5 s. At t₁, the switch moves to position 2, connecting the coil to resistor R₀. A retraction force F = (800-10v) N is applied from t₁ to t₃. The mover eventually returns to its starting position. The task is to find the constant current I from the current source.",
