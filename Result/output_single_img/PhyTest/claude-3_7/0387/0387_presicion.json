    "conclusion": "The slider (2kg mass) is ejected at point B with velocity vB. It travels horizontally to point C. At C, it enters a circular arc track with radius R = 0.4m. The arc ends at point D, where the track is tangent to the horizontal ground. Point D is at angle θ = 37° to the vertical (measured from point O, the center of the arc). The slider then slides along the rough ground (μ = 0.4) from D to landing point E.",

    "premise": "At point C: Position: at height h = 0.53m. Kinetic energy: ½mv²C (where vC = vB since there's no change in speed from B to C). Potential energy: mgh = 2kg × 9.8m/s² × 0.53m = 10.388J. At point D: Position: at height h' = R(1-sinθ) = 0.4m × (1-0.6) = 0.4m × 0.4 = 0.16m. Potential energy: mgh' = 2kg × 9.8m/s² × 0.16m = 3.136J.",
    "conclusion": "From conservation of energy: ½mvC² + mghC = ½mvD² + mghD. Therefore: ½m(vD)² = ½m(vB)² + 10.388J - 3.136J = ½m(vB)² + 7.252J. vD² = (vB)² + 7.252J/(0.5 × 2kg) = (vB)² + 7.252. vD = √((vB)² + 7.252).",
