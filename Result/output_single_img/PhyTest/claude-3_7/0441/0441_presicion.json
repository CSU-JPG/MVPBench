    "conclusion": "We have an optical fiber bent into a semicircle. The fiber has diameter D and refractive index N. Light enters perpendicular to face A and must exit from face B. Outside the fiber is vacuum (refractive index = 1). We need to find the minimum turning radius R for total internal reflection.",

    "conclusion": "For total internal reflection (TIR) to occur, the angle of incidence must be greater than the critical angle: Critical angle: θc = arcsin(n₂/n₁) where n₁ > n₂. In our case: θc = arcsin(1/N)",
