    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "Incident angle θ equals reflection angle θ, reflection angle is 90° - α, where α is the angle the radius to P makes with the horizontal",

  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "Using Snell's law: 1 × sin(θ₁) = √3 × sin(0), sin(θ₁) = 0, thus θ₁ = 0, meaning incident ray is perpendicular to surface at M",
