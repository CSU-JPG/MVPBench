    "conclusion": "Glass sphere with right side silvered, light source S on the axis of symmetry, two light paths to analyze: 1. Light reflects off the surface and goes vertically upward 2. Light enters the sphere, reflects off silvered surface, returns along original path. Given: radius = R, refractive index = √3. Need to find: distance SM",
    "judgment": "N/A"

  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "premise": "For light to reflect vertically upward, it must hit the sphere at a point where the incident angle equals the reflection angle (law of reflection).",
    "conclusion": "The incident angle θ equals the reflection angle θ.",
    "judgment": "Reasonable"
  },
  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "premise": "The reflection angle is 90° - α, where α is the angle the radius to P makes with the horizontal.",

    "judgment": "Reasonable"
  },
  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "premise": "Incident angle = reflection angle = θ. The reflected ray is vertical, so it's at 90° from horizontal. The normal and reflected ray make angle θ = 45°.",

    "conclusion": "The point P must be located at coordinates (0, R) relative to the center of the sphere. This is the topmost point of the sphere, which is actually point M in the diagram.",

  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "premise": "The incident ray from S to M and the refracted ray inside the sphere must satisfy Snell's law: n₁ × sin(θ₁) = n₂ × sin(θ₂), where n₁ = 1 (air), n₂ = √3 (glass), θ₁ = angle of incidence from S to M, θ₂ = angle of refraction inside the sphere.",
    "conclusion": "For the light to hit the silvered surface normally, the refracted ray must pass through the center of the sphere. This means θ₂ = 0.",

    "premise": "For the incident ray to be perpendicular to the surface at M, the light source S must be positioned along the axis passing through the center of the sphere and point M.",
