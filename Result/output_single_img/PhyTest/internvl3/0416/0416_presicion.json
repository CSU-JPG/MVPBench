    "conclusion": "When light passes from one medium to another, it refracts (changes direction) based on the refractive indices of the media. The refractive index \\( n \\) of a medium is related to the speed of light in that medium: \\( n = \\frac{c}{v} \\), where \\( c \\) is the speed of light in a vacuum and \\( v \\) is the speed of light in the medium.",
