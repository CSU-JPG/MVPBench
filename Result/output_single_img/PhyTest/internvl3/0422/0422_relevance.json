    "conclusion": "The ball has a hollow center with a radius ratio of 1:2. A thin beam of light (red, green, and purple) is incident at an angle i = 45°. The green light (B) refracts such that its path is tangent to the inner wall.",

    "conclusion": "The speed of light in a medium is given by v = c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum and n is the refractive index of the medium.",
    "relevant": "Yes"

    "step_type": "background information",

    "conclusion": "Snell's Law states n1 sin i = n2 sin r, where i is the incident angle, r is the refracted angle, n1 is the refractive index of the initial medium (air, n1 ≈ 1), and n2 is the refractive index of the transparent material.",

  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "For the green light to be tangent to the inner wall, the refracted angle must be such that the light just grazes the inner surface. This implies a specific relationship between the refractive indices and the geometry of the ball.",

    "conclusion": "Since green light is tangent to the inner wall, its path defines a critical condition. The refractive index for green light can be derived from the geometry and the given angles.",
    "relevant": "Yes"

  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "The speed of light in the material is inversely proportional to the refractive index. Therefore, the light with the highest refractive index travels the slowest.",

    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "Given that purple light generally has the highest refractive index, it will have the smallest propagation speed in the transparent material.",
