    "conclusion": "Identify the given information: Two uncharged vertical parallel metal plates are separated by a distance d. A charged small ball with a weight of G falls between the plates. The motion trajectory of the ball is AB. When a voltage U is applied between the plates, the direction of the force on the ball changes to BC.",

    "step_type": "background information",
    "conclusion": "Understand the forces acting on the ball: The ball is initially under the influence of gravity. When the voltage is applied, the force on the ball changes direction, indicating the presence of an electric field.",

    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "Apply the principle of electrostatics: The force on the ball is given by F = q · U, where q is the charge of the ball. Since the force changes direction, the electric field must be changing direction as well.",

    "conclusion": "Substitute the known values: Given G = 10 N and E = U/d, we have q = 10/(U/d) = 10d/U.",
