    "conclusion": "Two uncharged vertical parallel metal plates are separated by a distance d. A charged small ball with a weight of G falls between the plates. The motion trajectory of the ball is AB. When a voltage U is applied between the plates, the direction of the force on the ball changes to BC.",
