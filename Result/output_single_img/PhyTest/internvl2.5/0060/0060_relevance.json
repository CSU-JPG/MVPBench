    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "Identify the forces acting on the rod: gravitational force F_g acts downward due to the mass of the rod, magnetic force F_B acts due to the current in the rod and the magnetic field, and tension in the strings T acts upward to balance the gravitational force when the rod is stationary.",

    "step_type": "logical inference",
