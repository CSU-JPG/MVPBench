    "conclusion": "Loading and unloading are essential components of the logistics process. The speed of the conveyor is adjustable, allowing different speeds to be set for different types of goods. The length of the conveyor is also adjustable, enabling it to extend directly into trailers for operation. Additionally, the height of the conveyor can be adjusted, making it convenient for workers to directly handle goods located at higher positions in the cargo compartment.",
