Q is initially at rest at point A on the inclined plane. P collides elastically with Q with an upward velocity v0 along the inclined plane.",

    "conclusion": "The coefficient of kinetic friction between Q and the inclined plane is equal to tan θ, and the maximum static friction is equal to the sliding friction. There is no friction between P and the inclined plane, and there is no loss of kinetic energy in the collision between P and the bumper. Both blocks can be considered as point masses. The inclined plane is sufficiently long, and P will not collide with Q before Q's velocity reduces to zero. The magnitude of gravitational acceleration is g.",
