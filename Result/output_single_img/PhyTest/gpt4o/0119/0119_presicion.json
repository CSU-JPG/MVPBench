    "conclusion": "Since the surface is smooth, there is no friction between the blocks and the surface. The only horizontal force applied is F on block B. The spring between blocks B and C will exert a force due to its extension or compression.",

    "conclusion": "Since all blocks accelerate together, they share the same acceleration, a. According to Newton's second law, the net force on each block is equal to the mass of the block times its acceleration (F = ma).",
