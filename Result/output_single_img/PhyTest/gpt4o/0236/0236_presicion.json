The frame is placed perpendicular to a uniform magnetic field, and points A and B are connected to a power supply with constant voltage. The current passing through the wire generates an Ampere force due to the interaction with the magnetic field.",

    "conclusion": "The Ampere force (Lorentz force) on a current-carrying wire in a magnetic field is given by the formula: F = I · L · B · sin(θ) where I is the current, L is the length of the wire, B is the magnetic field strength, and θ is the angle between the wire and the magnetic field direction. Since the wire is perpendicular to the magnetic field, θ = 90° and sin(90°) = 1.",
