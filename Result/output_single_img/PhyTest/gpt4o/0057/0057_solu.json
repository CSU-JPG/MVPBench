        "Calculate the total resistance in the circuit by adding the internal resistance and the series resistors: R_total = r + R1 + R2 + R3 = 2Ω + 2Ω + 3Ω + 6Ω = 13Ω",
        "Determine the current in the circuit using Ohm's Law: I = E / R_total = 6V / 13Ω = 0.4615A",
        "Calculate the voltage across the capacitor, which is the same as the voltage across R2 and R3 since they are in parallel: V_C = I * (R2 || R3) = 0.4615A * (3Ω || 6Ω) = 0.4615A * 2Ω = 0.923V",
        "Use the formula Q = C * V to find the charge on the capacitor: Q = 10μF * 0.923V = 9.23μC = 9.23 * 10^-6 C"
