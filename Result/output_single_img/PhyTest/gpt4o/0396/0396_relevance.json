    "conclusion": "A force is applied to the piston, moving it upwards slowly. This compresses the gas in the lower chamber and increases its pressure. The process is slow, so we can assume it is quasi-static, meaning the system remains in equilibrium at each step.",

The pressure in the upper chamber remains p since it is initially at equilibrium and no gas has leaked yet. The force due to the pressure difference is (P1 - p)A, where A is the cross-sectional area of the diaphragm.",
