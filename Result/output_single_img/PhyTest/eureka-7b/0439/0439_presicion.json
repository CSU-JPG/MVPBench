The relationship between the incident angle θ and the refraction angle β is given by Snell's law: n1 sin θ = n2 sin β where n1 is the refractive index of the initial medium (air in this case), n2 is the refractive index of the second medium (sucrose water in the cups), and θ and β are the incident and refraction angles, respectively.",
