    "conclusion": "The early warning radar detects an enemy aircraft flying horizontally at a constant speed at an altitude of 20000m. An anti-aircraft missile with a mass of m=100kg is launched. The missile accelerates uniformly upward from rest with an acceleration of a=10g until it reaches an altitude of 5000m. The direction of the gas expulsion changes to an angle θ (cosθ=1/11) downward and to the right, causing the missile to follow a curved trajectory until it hits the enemy aircraft.",
