The work done by the air resistance is given by W_air = -lambda mg * s, where s is the total distance traveled by the basketball. The total distance traveled by the basketball is 2H (down and up), so the work done by the air resistance is W_air = -2lambda mgH.",

  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "premise": "At the highest point after the collision, the kinetic energy is zero and the potential energy is mgh. The work done by the air resistance during the ascent is -lambda mg h, so the mechanical energy lost due to air resistance is lambda mg h.",
    "conclusion": "The initial kinetic energy at the bottom is 1/2mv_0^2, and the final kinetic energy at the top is 1/2mv_f^2. The work done by the air resistance during the descent is -lambda mg H, so the mechanical energy lost due to air resistance is lambda mg H.",

    "premise": "The ratio of the post-collision velocity to the pre-collision velocity is v_f/v_0. Using the work-energy theorem, the work done by the air resistance is -lambda mg * 2H = -2lambda mgH, so the change in kinetic energy is: Delta K = 1/2mv_f^2 - 1/2mv_0^2 = -2lambda mgH",
