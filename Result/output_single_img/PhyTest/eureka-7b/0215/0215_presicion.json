    "conclusion": "The electromagnetic flowmeter works based on the principle of the Lorentz force. When a conducting fluid flows through a magnetic field, it experiences a force due to the interaction between the magnetic field and the moving charges in the fluid. This force induces an electromotive force (EMF) between the points M and N on the pipe wall.",
