    "conclusion": "The angle of refraction r is complementary to the angle of incidence i in the context of the geometry of the problem. Since the angle of incidence is 45°, the angle of refraction r must be such that the path is tangent to the inner wall. This implies that the angle of refraction is 90° - 45° = 45°.",

    "conclusion": "Since the angle of refraction r = 45° and the incident angle i = 45°, we have n1 sin 45° = n2 sin 45°. This simplifies to n1 = n2, which is not possible since the light is refracting.",
