It undergoes an inelastic collision with the ground and rebounds to a maximum height $h$ above the ground. The magnitude of the air resistance experienced by the basketball during its motion is $\\lambda$ times the magnitude of the gravitational force acting on the basketball (where $\\lambda$ is a constant and $0<\\lambda<\\frac{H-h}{H+h}$). The ratio of the post-collision velocity to the pre-collision velocity is the same for each collision with the ground. The magnitude of the gravitational acceleration is $g$.
