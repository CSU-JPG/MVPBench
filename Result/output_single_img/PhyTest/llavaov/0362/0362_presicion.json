The particle's motion can be analyzed in two dimensions: along the direction of the electric field (y-axis) and perpendicular to it (x-axis). Since the electric field is uniform, the acceleration in the y-direction is constant and given by $a_y = \\frac{F}{m} = \\frac{qE}{m}$, where $E$ is the electric field strength. There is no acceleration in the x-direction, so the particle's velocity in the x-direction remains constant.",

The distance traveled in the x-direction is $R\\cos(60^\\circ) = \\frac{R}{2}$. The distance traveled in the y-direction is $R\\sin(60^\\circ) = \\frac{R\\sqrt{3}}{2}$. Using the kinematic equation $v^2 = u^2 + 2as$, where $u$ is the initial velocity, $v$ is the final velocity, $a$ is the acceleration, and $s$ is the distance, we can find the acceleration in the y-direction. For the y-direction, $v_{0y}^2 = 0 + 2a_y \\left(\\frac{R\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)$. Substituting $v_{0y} = \\frac{v_0\\sqrt{3}}{2}$ and $a_y = \\frac{qE}{m}$, we get $\\left(\\frac{v_0\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)^2 = 2\\left(\\frac{qE}{m}\\right)\\left(\\frac{R\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)$.",
