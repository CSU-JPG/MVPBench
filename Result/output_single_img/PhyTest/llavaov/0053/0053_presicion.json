    "conclusion": "An electromagnetic railgun fire truck utilizes electromagnetic propulsion technology to launch fire extinguishing projectiles into high-rise buildings for rapid fire suppression. The energy stored in capacitors is converted into the kinetic energy of the projectile through electromagnetic induction. By setting the working voltage of the energy storage capacitors, the desired muzzle velocity of the projectile can be achieved. The railgun is aimed directly at a high-rise building, with a horizontal distance L=60m between them. The muzzle velocity of the projectile is v0=50m/s, and the launch angle relative to the horizontal plane is θ=53°. Neglecting the height of the railgun above the ground and air resistance, and taking the acceleration due to gravity as g=10m/s², and sin53°=0.8.",
