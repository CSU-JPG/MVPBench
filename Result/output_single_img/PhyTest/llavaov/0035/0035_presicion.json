    "conclusion": "Since the winter began, haze weather with visibility less than 100m has occurred multiple times in many places across the country. During such severe weather, two cars, Car A and Car B, were traveling in the same direction on a straight one-way road, with Car B in front and Car A behind. At a certain moment, the drivers of both cars simultaneously heard a siren warning of an accident ahead and started braking at the same time, but unfortunately, the two cars collided. The diagram shows the v-t graph for the two cars just before they would have avoided colliding. From this, at what time do the two cars collide, before or after 20 seconds of braking?",
