    "conclusion": "A spherical ice droplet falls through an atmospheric layer with a temperature inversion. The droplet melts partially in the warmer layer between heights h_A and h_B, and then partially freezes again before reaching the ground. Assume constant droplet size and atmospheric density, leading to constant fall velocity. The temperature profile is linear below 2 km. Specific heat of water is c_water = 4.2 kJ kg^-1 K^-1 and specific heat of ice is c_ice = 2.1 kJ kg^-1 K^-1. The specific latent heat for melting of ice is L = 334 kJ kg^-1. The area between the temperature curve and the height-axis in the melting region is A = 5.0 km °C, and the area in the freezing region is A' = 4.0 km °C.",
