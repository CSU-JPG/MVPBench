    "conclusion": "A long metallic pipe with internal diameter d is pointing directly downwards. Water (density ρ, surface tension σ) slowly drips from a nozzle at its lower end, forming droplets of radius r. Assume d ≪ r. Surface tension contributes a force F = σ l where l is the length of the separation and a surface energy U=σ S where S is the surface area. The droplet separates when gravity overcomes surface tension. The pipe is at potential φ relative to surroundings. Two such pipes are set up in a Kelvin water dropper arrangement. Find the radius r_max of a drop just before it separates from the nozzle.",
