During the subsequent motion, the block does not leave the plate. Given that M=2m, neither the block and the plate nor the plate and the horizontal surface are smooth. The relationship between the velocity of the block and time from t=0 is shown in Figure B. The acceleration due to gravity is g=10m/s^2.",
