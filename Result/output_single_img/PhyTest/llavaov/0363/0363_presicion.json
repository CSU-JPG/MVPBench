    "conclusion": "The principle of a certain negative ion air purification is shown in the figure. A mixed airflow consisting of air and negatively charged dust particles enters a collector composed of a pair of parallel metal plates. The velocity v0 of the air and charged particles along the direction of the plates remains constant. Under the action of a uniform electric field, the charged particles hit the metal plates and are collected. The length of the metal plates is L and the spacing between the plates is d. The effects of gravity and inter-particle interactions are negligible. Air resistance is neglected, and all particles with mass m and charge -α are just completely collected.",
