    "conclusion": "Substitute these values into Snell's Law: 1 * sin 60° = √3 * sin θ2. sin 60° = √3/2. So, √3/2 = √3 * sin θ2. sin θ2 = 1/2. Thus, θ2 = 30°.",

    "conclusion": "Substitute these values into Snell's Law: √3 * sin 30° = 1 * sin θ1. sin 30° = 1/2. So, √3 * 1/2 = sin θ1. sin θ1 = √3/2. Thus, θ1 = 60°.",

    "conclusion": "The coordinates of point B are (R, 0) and the coordinates of point A are (0, 0). The light travels in a straight line from B to the screen MN. The slope of the line from B to the screen is: tan 60° = √3. The equation of the line is: y = √3(x - R). At the screen MN, x = 0: y = √3(0 - R) = -√3R. The distance from point A to where the light hits the screen is the absolute value of y: √3R.",
