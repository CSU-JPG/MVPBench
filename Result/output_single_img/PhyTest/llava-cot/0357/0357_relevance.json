    "conclusion": "The image shows a horizontal metal ring with a radius of 0.2 m, fixed and rotating with an angular velocity of 600 rad/s. Two metal rods, each with a length of 0.2 m, are placed along the diameter of the ring. A uniform magnetic field with a magnetic induction strength of B1 exists in the left half of the ring. A capacitor with a capacitance of 0.09 F is connected between two parallel horizontal metal tracks with a distance of l1. A metal rod ab is placed perpendicularly to the track near the left edge within the magnetic field region. A '[' shaped metal frame fcde is placed on the horizontal section of the insulated tracks.",
