The side length of the cube is $L$. Point $A$ is another vertex of the cube. The midpoint $O$ of the line connecting the two charges is also marked.",

    "conclusion": "The electric field at any point due to a point charge is given by Coulomb's law: $E = k \\frac{q}{r^2}$, where $k$ is Coulomb's constant, $q$ is the charge, and $r$ is the distance from the charge to the point.",

    "step_type": "logical inference",
