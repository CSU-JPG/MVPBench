    "conclusion": "The image depicts a well with a depth of 8 meters and a circular wellhead radius of 0.5 meters. The well is filled with water, and the refractive index of water is given as n = 4/3. A frog is positioned at the center of the bottom of the well, and it wants to see the scenery outside the well. The image shows light rays from the frog's position, which are refracted and reflected at the water-air interface.",
