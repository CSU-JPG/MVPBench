    "premise": "The cyclic process involves four stages: A→B, B→C, C→D, and D→A. Since it is a cyclic process, the net change in internal energy is zero.",
    "conclusion": "This implies that the change in temperature is also zero, meaning the temperature at the end of the cycle is the same as the initial temperature.",
