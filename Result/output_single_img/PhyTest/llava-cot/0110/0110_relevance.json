    "conclusion": "The image shows a hemispherical bowl on a horizontal surface with three balls labeled A, B, and C connected by two thin wires. Ball B is just touching the bowl's wall, and the angle θ between the wires is 30°.",
    "relevant": "Yes"

    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "The system is in equilibrium, so the forces acting on each ball must balance.",
    "relevant": "Yes"

  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "For ball B, the force of the bowl's wall is equal to the weight of ball B, which is mg_B.",

    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "The angle θ = 30° implies that the vertical component of T_A is 1/2 T_A.",
    "relevant": "Yes"
  },
  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "Since ball B is just touching the wall, the force on B is mg_B, and this equals the vertical component of T_A, so 1/2 T_A = mg_B.",
    "relevant": "Yes"

    "conclusion": "The mass ratio of A to C is given by m_A/m_C = T_A/T_C = 2mg_B/mg_C = 2/1.",

    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "The mass ratio of the A ball to the C ball is 2:1.",
