    "premise": "In the P-V diagram, the process A→B is an isothermal expansion. During an isothermal expansion, the temperature of the gas remains constant, but the volume increases.",
    "conclusion": "According to the first law of thermodynamics, for an isothermal expansion, the internal energy of the gas remains constant.",

  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "premise": "Since the internal energy is constant, any increase in the gas's energy must come from heat absorption.",
