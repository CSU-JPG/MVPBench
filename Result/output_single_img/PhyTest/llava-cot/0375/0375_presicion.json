    "conclusion": "Two metal rails are placed parallel to each other on the same horizontal plane, separated by a distance of l = 0.6 m. The left and right ends of the rails are connected to lamps L₁ and L₂ with specifications '3V, 3W' and '6V, 6W' respectively. A conductor rod ab with resistance r = 1 Ω is placed on the rails and is perpendicular to them. A uniform magnetic field with magnetic induction B = 1 T passes vertically through the plane of the rails. When the conductor rod moves to the right at a constant speed under the action of an external force, lamp L₁ just lights up normally. The resistance of the rails is negligible.",
