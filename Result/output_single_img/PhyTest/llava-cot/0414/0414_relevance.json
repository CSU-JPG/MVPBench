    "step_type": "image description",
    "conclusion": "The image shows a glass hemisphere with radius R, center labeled O, optical axis as dashed line OO', perpendicular to the base, and a beam of parallel light incident vertically on the base.",
    "relevant": "Yes"
  },
  {
    "step_type": "background information",
    "conclusion": "The refractive index of the glass is given as 1.5, meaning light will bend towards the normal when entering the glass.",

    "step_type": "logical inference",

    "relevant": "Yes"
  },
  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "Calculating sin θc gives sin θc = 1.5/1 = 1.5. Since sin θ cannot exceed 1, the critical angle is not applicable here.",

  },
  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "Consider the geometry of the hemisphere. The maximum distance from the optical axis for the incident ray occurs when the light is refracted at the critical angle, which is not directly applicable here.",

  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "The maximum distance from the optical axis for the incident ray is determined by the geometry of the hemisphere and the angle of incidence. The maximum distance is given as R/2.",
