    "conclusion": "Loading and unloading are essential components of the logistics process. The speed of the conveyor is adjustable, allowing different speeds to be set for different types of goods. The length of the conveyor is also adjustable, enabling it to extend directly into trailers for operation. Additionally, the height of the conveyor can be adjusted, making it convenient for workers to directly handle goods located at higher positions in the cargo compartment.",

    "conclusion": "If cargo (which can be considered as a particle) is at the same height as the conveyor, the schematic diagram of the conveying process is shown in Figure C. It is known that the length of the conveyor is L1=6m, and the conveyor moves clockwise at a speed of v0=2m/s. The kinetic friction coefficient between cargo A and the conveyor is μ1=0.2. Cargo is released from rest at the left end of the conveyor. Find the acceleration of cargo A when it is just placed on the conveyor and the time it takes to travel from the left end to the right end. (Take g=10m/s².)",
