    "conclusion": "In the process of chip manufacturing, ion implantation is a crucial step. Ions are accelerated and enter a velocity selector horizontally, then pass through a magnetic analyzer, which selects ions with a specific charge-to-mass ratio. Subsequently, the ions are deflected by a deflection system and implanted into a wafer (silicon chip) lying in the horizontal plane.",
