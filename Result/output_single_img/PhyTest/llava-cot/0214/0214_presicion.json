    "conclusion": "The image shows a circuit with a voltage source U, an ammeter, a switch, a resistor R1 = 20Ω, and a motor with internal resistance R2 = 10Ω. The ammeter measures current I0 = 0.5A when the switch is open.",

    "premise": "When the switch is open, the circuit consists of the voltage source U, the ammeter, and the resistor R1. The current I0 is measured as 0.5 A.",
    "conclusion": "Using Ohm's law, I0 = U / (R1 + R2), we can find the total resistance R1 + R2 when the switch is open. Substituting the known values, 0.5 = U / (20 + 10), which simplifies to 0.5 = U / 30. Solving for U, we get U = 15 V.",

    "premise": "When the switch is closed, the motor starts to rotate, but the voltage U remains unchanged at 15 V.",
    "conclusion": "The power P consumed by the circuit is given by P = I × U. Since the voltage remains constant at 15 V, the power consumed will be proportional to the current.",

  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "premise": "The relationship between the power P and the given value 15W is determined by the ratio of the currents when the switch is open and closed. Since the voltage is constant, the power will be proportional to the current.",
    "conclusion": "Therefore, the relationship between the electric power P consumed by the circuit and 15W is that P is proportional to the current when the switch is closed, which is the same as when the switch is open.",
