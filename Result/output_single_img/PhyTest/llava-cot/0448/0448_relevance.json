    "conclusion": "The image shows a semicircular material brick with a right triangle on the right. The semicircle has a diameter BC, and O is the center. A beam of red light is directed at the center O. The triangle ABC has ∠A = 30°, and a screen MN is perpendicular to the horizontal plane at point A. The angle between the incident direction and BC is 60°.",

    "step_type": "logical inference",

    "conclusion": "The refracted angle ∠BOC is calculated using Snell's law: n = sin(∠i) / sin(∠r), where n is the refractive index. Thus, sin(60°) / sin(∠BOC) = √3, giving ∠BOC = 30°.",
