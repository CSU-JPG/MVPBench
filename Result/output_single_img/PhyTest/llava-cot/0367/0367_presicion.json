    "conclusion": "A basketball of mass m is dropped from rest at a height H above the ground. It undergoes an inelastic collision with the ground and rebounds to a maximum height h above the ground. The magnitude of the air resistance experienced by the basketball during its motion is λ times the magnitude of the gravitational force acting on the basketball (where λ is a constant and 0<λ<(H-h)/(H+h)). The ratio of the post-collision velocity to the pre-collision velocity is the same for each collision with the ground. The magnitude of the gravitational acceleration is g. Determine the ratio of the post-collision velocity to the pre-collision velocity of the basketball during its collision with the ground.",

The graph has three segments: a vertical line from 0 to 1.5 seconds with a force of 1.5 N, a horizontal line from 1.5 to 6 seconds with a force of 1.0 N, and a horizontal line from 6 to 8 seconds with a force of 0.5 N.

The gravitational force is mg, where m is the mass of the basketball and g is the gravitational acceleration. Therefore, the air resistance is λmg.",
