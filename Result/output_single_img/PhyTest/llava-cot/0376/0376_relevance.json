    "step_type": "image description",
    "conclusion": "The image shows a square region abcd with side length 2L. There is a uniform magnetic field directed perpendicularly into the plane of the paper. Metal plates MN and PQ are placed within the square, with MN on the left half of side ad and both plates extending from side ab. The length and distance between the plates are L. A negatively charged particle is injected along the central line SO of the plates.",
    "relevant": "Yes"

  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "The particle moves in a straight line under the influence of the electric and magnetic fields. The electric field E is directed from N to P, and the magnetic field B is directed perpendicularly into the plane.",
    "relevant": "Yes"

  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "The particle's motion is described by the equations: x = vt, y = (qE/m)t, vx = (qE/mB)B, vy = v.",
    "relevant": "Yes"
  },
  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "Since the particle just fails to exit the magnetic field, it reaches the right boundary at x = L. From equation x = vt, we have vt = L, which implies v = L/t.",
    "relevant": "Yes"
  },
  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "The vertical displacement is given by y = (qE/m)t. Since the particle reaches the top boundary at y = L, we have (qE/m)t = L, which implies t = mL/qE.",
    "relevant": "Yes"
  },
  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "Substituting t = mL/qE into the expression for v, we get v = L/(mL/qE) = qE/m.",
    "relevant": "Yes"

  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "Thus, the magnitude of the velocity of the particle when it is shot into point S is qE/m.",
