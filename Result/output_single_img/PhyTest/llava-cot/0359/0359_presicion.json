    "premise": "Evidence (only for logical inference)",
    "conclusion": "The image shows two vertical baffles, P and M, with a spacing of l. The upper edges P and M are at the same horizontal level. Above this level, there is a uniform electric field directed vertically downwards with a strength of E. Between the baffles, there is a uniform magnetic field perpendicular to the paper and outward. A particle with mass m and charge q is launched horizontally to the right with a velocity of magnitude v0 from a point in the electric field. It enters the magnetic field at point P and exits between the lower edges Q and N.",

  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "premise": "The particle's motion is influenced by both the electric and magnetic fields. Initially, in the electric field, the particle experiences a force F = qE, causing it to accelerate vertically downward. However, since the particle is launched horizontally, the vertical acceleration is negligible, and the horizontal velocity remains constant.",
    "conclusion": "The horizontal velocity of the particle remains constant as it enters the magnetic field.",
    "judgment": "Reasonable"

  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "premise": "Upon entering the magnetic field, the particle experiences a force F = qvB, where v is the velocity of the particle, and B is the magnetic field strength. This force acts perpendicular to both the velocity and the magnetic field direction, causing the particle to move in a circular path.",
    "conclusion": "The particle moves in a circular path upon entering the magnetic field.",
    "judgment": "Reasonable"
  },
  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "premise": "Given that the angle between the particle's velocity direction and PQ is 60°, we can use the equation for the radius of the circular path: r = v / (ω), where ω is the angular velocity.",
    "conclusion": "The radius of the circular path is determined by the equation r = v / ω.",
    "judgment": "Reasonable"
  },
  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "premise": "The relationship between the velocity components and the angle is: v_x = v * cos(60°) = v/2",

  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",

    "judgment": "Reasonable"

  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
