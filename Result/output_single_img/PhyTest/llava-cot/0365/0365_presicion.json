    "conclusion": "A school is conducting safety education for students. The speaker uses remote-controlled motorcycle and car models to demonstrate a pursuit scenario. The two vehicles travel in the same direction with uniform velocity on a straight track. The motorcycle is behind the car. When the distance between the two vehicles is L=1.5m, an accident occurs ahead, and both vehicles begin braking simultaneously. The velocity-time graph of the motorcycle after braking is shown in the figure, and the relationship between the velocity of the car and time is given by v2=3-0.25t (where v2 is in m/s and t is in s). To prevent the motorcycle from colliding with the car, what is the minimum safe distance between the two vehicles?",

    "conclusion": "The image shows a velocity-time graph for a motorcycle. The graph indicates that the motorcycle starts at a velocity of 4 m/s and decelerates to 0 m/s over a period of 8 seconds.",

    "conclusion": "To find when the car stops, set v2 = 0: 3 - 0.25t = 0 implies t = 12 seconds. Thus, the car stops after 12 seconds.",

    "premise": "The motorcycle stops after 8 seconds, so the car is still moving when the motorcycle stops.",
