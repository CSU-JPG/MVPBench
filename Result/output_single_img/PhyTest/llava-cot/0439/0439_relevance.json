    "conclusion": "The image shows two identical glasses, A and B, with light beams entering at angle θ, refracting to angles β1 and β2. Black dots indicate quartering points of glass diameters.",

    "conclusion": "Greater sucrose concentration means greater refractive index. Refraction occurs when light passes between media with different refractive indices.",

  },
  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "Using Snell's law, since θ is the same for both glasses, the refractive index affects angle β. β1 > β2 implies refractive index of glass A is greater than glass B.",
