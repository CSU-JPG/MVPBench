    "conclusion": "The image shows two velocity-time graphs labeled as Car A and Car B. Car A's graph is a concave upward curve, starting from 0 velocity and increasing linearly. Car B's graph is a concave downward curve, starting from a higher velocity and decreasing linearly. Both graphs are bounded by the lines v1 and v2.",

    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "For Car A, the velocity increases from 0 to v2 over time, indicating a positive acceleration that is decreasing because the curve is concave upward.",
