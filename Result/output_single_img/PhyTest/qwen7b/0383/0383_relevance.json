    "conclusion": "Since the rod moves horizontally, the gravitational force acts vertically downward, and the magnetic force acts perpendicular to both the direction of motion and the magnetic field. This means that the magnetic force does not contribute to the horizontal motion but rather opposes any vertical motion if the rod were to move vertically.",
