    "conclusion": "Understand the principle behind the electromagnetic flowmeter: In an electromagnetic flowmeter, a uniform magnetic field B is applied perpendicular to the direction of fluid flow. When a conducting fluid flows through this magnetic field, it experiences a Lorentz force due to the interaction between the magnetic field and the moving charges in the fluid. This Lorentz force causes a voltage (electromotive force, EMF) to be generated across the pipe walls.",
