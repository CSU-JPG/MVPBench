    "conclusion": "Total internal reflection (TIR) occurs when light travels from a medium with a higher refractive index to one with a lower refractive index, and the angle of incidence is greater than the critical angle (θc). The critical angle is given by: sin(θc) = n2/n1 where n1 is the refractive index of the first medium (the one where the light originates), and n2 is the refractive index of the second medium (the one where the light is incident).",
