  ["The volume of the solid is determined by the displacement of air, which is measured by the change in water level in the U-tube.", "The difference in water levels (h) in the U-tube indicates the volume of air displaced.", "The volume of air displaced is equal to the volume of the solid.", "Using the formula V = A * h, where A is the cross-sectional area of the U-tube and h is the height difference.", "Given A = 5.0 × 10⁻⁴ m² and h = 1.56 × 10⁻¹ m, calculate V = 5.0 × 10⁻⁴ m² * 1.56 × 10⁻¹ m.", "The calculated volume is 7.8 × 10⁻⁵ m³."]
