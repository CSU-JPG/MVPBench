{3}r\). The refractive index of the liquid is \(n = \sqrt{2}\). We need to find out how much the light source should be moved vertically upward so that the light emitted from \(S\) is just not visible above the water surface.

First, I need to understand the setup. We have a light source underwater, and it's shining light towards the surface. Some of this light will refract out into the air, and some might be totally internally reflected if the angle is too shallow. The wooden board is covering part of the surface, but it's only covering the center with radius \(r\), so light could still escape elsewhere.

But the question is about moving the light source upward until the light is just not visible above the water surface. I think this means that we need to find the position of \(S\) such that the light rays just graze the critical angle for total internal reflection at the water-air interface.

Let me recall Snell's Law: \(n_1 \sin \theta_1 = n_2 \sin \theta_2\), where \(n_1\) and \(n_2\) are the refractive indices of the two media, and \(\theta_1\) and \(\theta_2\) are the angles of incidence and refraction, respectively.

In this case, light is going from water (refractive index \(n = \sqrt{2}\)) to air (refractive index approximately 1). The critical angle \(\theta_c\) for total internal reflection is given by \(\sin \theta_c = \frac{1}{n} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\), so \(\theta_c = \sin^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
