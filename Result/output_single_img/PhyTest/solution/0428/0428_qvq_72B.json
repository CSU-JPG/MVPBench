[
\sin \theta_c = \frac{1}{n}
\]

where n is the refractive index of water, and θ_c is the critical angle.

Given that θ_c is 41 degrees, we can plug that into the equation:

\[
\sin 41^\circ = \frac{1}{n}
\]

Solving for n:

\[
n = \frac{1}{\sin 41^\circ}
\]

Wait a minute, the final answer provided is:

\[
n = \frac{1}{\sin 49^\circ}
\]

Hmm, there's a discrepancy here. The problem says that when α is greater than 41 degrees, the beam can be received, implying that at 41 degrees, total internal reflection occurs. So, the critical angle should be 41 degrees, and thus the refractive index should be 1 over sin(41 degrees), not sin(49 degrees).

Let me double-check this. The critical angle θ_c is given by:

\[
\theta_c = \arcsin \left( \frac{1}{n} \right)
\]
