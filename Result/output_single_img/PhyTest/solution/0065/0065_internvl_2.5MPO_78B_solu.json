Explanation of Key Reasoning Steps:

1. **Conservation of Momentum**: The momentum of the system (bullet + ball) is conserved in the horizontal direction during the collision. The initial momentum of the bullet is \( mv_0 \), and the final momentum of the system is \( (M+m)v \).

2. **Equation for Momentum**: From the conservation of momentum, \( mv_0 = (M+m)v \).

3. **Projectile Motion**: The ball and bullet move horizontally after the collision. The horizontal distance \( s \) is related to the horizontal velocity \( v \) and the time \( t \) it takes to fall from height \( h \).

4. **Time of Fall**: The time \( t \) can be found using the equation for free fall: \( h = \frac{1}{2}gt^2 \). Solving for \( t \) gives \( t = \sqrt{\frac{2h}{g}} \).

5. **Velocity Relation**: The horizontal velocity \( v \) is given by \( v = \frac{s}{t} \). Substituting \( t \) from step 4 into this equation gives \( v = \frac{s}{\sqrt{\frac{2h}{g}}} = s\sqrt{\frac{g}{2h}}
