[
\frac{P_A V_A}{T_A} = \frac{P_B V_B}{T_B}
\]

Plugging in the known values:

\[
\frac{P_0 \cdot V_0}{T_0} = \frac{(0.6 P_0) \cdot V_0}{T_B}
\]

Notice that \( V_0 \) appears on both sides, so they cancel out:

\[
\frac{P_0}{T_0} = \frac{0.6 P_0}{T_B}
\]

Now, solving for \( T_B \):

\[
T_B = 0.6 T_0
\]
