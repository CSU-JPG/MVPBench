{48R\pi}{180} = \frac{4\pi}{15}R \), and there are two key steps provided.

First, I need to understand what's going on here. There's a car with headlights that are 92.8 cm above the ground. There's a paraboloid reflector and a hemispherical lens involved, and there's a light-blocking plate below the symmetry axis. The light source is at the focal point of the paraboloid, and light is being reflected and entering the lens perpendicular to the vertical diameter MN.

The key steps mention total internal reflection and the critical angle. So, I think the problem is about determining the area on the lens where light is entering without being blocked by the light-blocking plate, and then finding the length of this transparent part along the spherical surface.

Let me try to rephrase and understand the steps.

**Key Step 1:**

"Let this light just totally reflect. At this time, the critical angle in the lens is c, which is defined by \(\sin{c} = \frac{1}{n}\), \(c = 48^\circ\)."

So, the refractive index \(n = \frac{4}{3}\), and the critical angle \(c = \arcsin\left(\frac{1}{n}\right) = \arcsin\left(\frac{3}{4}\right)\). Wait, hold on. The formula for the critical angle is \(\sin{c} = \frac{1}{n}\), so \(c = \arcsin\left(\frac{1}{n}\right) = \arcsin\left(\frac{3}{4}\right)\). What is \(\arcsin\left(\frac{3}{4}\right)\) in degrees?

I know that \(\sin(30^\circ) = 0.5\), \(\sin(45^\circ) \approx 0.707\), and \(\sin(60^\circ) \approx 0.866\). So, \(\frac{3}
