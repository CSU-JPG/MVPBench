  ["The electrostatic force between the two spheres is given by Coulomb's law: F_e = k * (q^2) / d^2"],
  ["The gravitational force component along the inclined plane is mg * sin θ"],
  ["Since the tension in the wire is zero, the electrostatic force must balance the gravitational force component along the plane"],
  ["Set the electrostatic force equal to the gravitational force component: k * (q^2) / d^2 = mg * sin θ"],
  ["The horizontal component of the electrostatic force is F_e * cos θ"],
  ["The vertical component of the electrostatic force is F_e * sin θ"],
  ["The horizontal component must balance the gravitational force component along the plane: F_e * cos θ = mg * sin θ"],
  ["Substitute F_e from Coulomb's law: (k * (q^2) / d^2) * cos θ = mg * sin θ"],
  ["Divide both sides by cos θ: k * (q^2) / d^2 = mg * tan θ"],
  ["Solve for q/d: (q/d)^2 = (mg * tan θ) / k"],
  ["Take the square root of both sides: q/d = sqrt((mg * tan θ) / k)"]
