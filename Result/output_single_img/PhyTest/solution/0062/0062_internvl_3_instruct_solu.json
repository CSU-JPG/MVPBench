  ["The electrostatic force between the two spheres is given by Coulomb's law: F_e = k * (q^2) / d^2"],
  ["The gravitational force acting on sphere A along the inclined plane is F_g = mg * sin θ"],
  ["Since the tension in the wire is zero, the electrostatic force must balance the component of gravitational force along the inclined plane: F_e = F_g"],
  ["Substitute the expressions for F_e and F_g: k * (q^2) / d^2 = mg * sin θ"],
  ["Solve for q/d: (q/d)^2 = (mg * sin θ) / k"],
  ["Take the square root of both sides: q/d = sqrt((mg * sin θ) / k)"]
