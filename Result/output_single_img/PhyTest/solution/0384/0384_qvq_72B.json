{-3} \) T (Tesla). There's a particle source at point S, which is located at a distance \( d = 1.2 \) m above the origin O. This source emits negatively charged particles in all directions within the first quadrant. These particles have a charge-to-mass ratio of \( \frac{q}{m} = 2 \times 10^{6} \) C/kg.

There's also a collection device placed on the positive x-axis, and when particles hit this device, they're absorbed. The device can export charge to maintain electrical neutrality, and we're to ignore any interactions between particles and gravity.

The problem asks for the velocity \( v_{1} \) of the particles when they reach the collection device, given that \( \sin 48.5^\circ = 0.75 \).

Alright, so to find \( v_{1} \), I need to understand how these particles move in the magnetic field and how their paths relate to the collection device.

First, in a uniform magnetic field, a charged particle moves in a circular path due to the Lorentz force acting perpendicular to both the velocity and the magnetic field. The radius of this circular path is given by:

\[
r = \frac{mv}{qB}
\]

where:

- \( m \) is the mass of the particle,

- \( q \) is the charge of the particle,

- \( v \) is the velocity of the particle,

- \( B \) is the magnetic field strength.

Given that the particles are emitted in all directions from point S, their paths will curve due to the magnetic field, and some of them will hit the collection device on the positive x-axis.
