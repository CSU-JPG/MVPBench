[
\frac{P_A V_A}{T_A} = \frac{P_B V_B}{T_B}
\]

Plugging in the known values:

\[
\frac{P_0 \cdot V_0}{T_0} = \frac{P_B \cdot 2V_0}{T_0}
\]

Notice that \(T_A = T_B = T_0\), which makes sense because AB is a horizontal line on the V-T diagram, indicating constant temperature.

Simplifying the equation:

\[
\frac{P_0 \cdot V_0}{T_0}
