[ a = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t} \]

So, to find the acceleration between 1 and 3 seconds, I need to look at how the velocity changes during that time interval.

Looking at the graph:

- From 0 to 1 second, the velocity is constant at 2 m/s.

- At 1 second, the velocity starts decreasing linearly.

- At 2 seconds, the velocity is 0 m/s.

- At 3 seconds, the velocity is -2 m/s.

So, between 1 and 3 seconds, the velocity decreases from 2 m/s to -2 m/s in a straight line, which means the acceleration is constant during this interval.

Now, to find the acceleration, I can calculate the slope of this straight line.

Let's identify two points on this line to calculate the slope. Let's take t = 1 s and t = 3 s.

At t = 1 s, v = 2 m/s

At t = 3 s, v = -2 m/s

The change in velocity, \(\Delta v = v_f - v_i = -2 - 2 = -4\) m/s

The change in time, \(\Delta t = t_f - t_i = 3 - 1 = 2\) s

Therefore, the acceleration is:

\[ a = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t} = \frac{-4}{2} = -2 \, \text{m/s}^2 \]
