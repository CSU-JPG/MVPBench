  ["First,the particle undergoes uniform linear motion with constant acceleration between 1 and 3 seconds.", "In a v-t graph, the slope of the curve represents acceleration.", "From the graph, it can be seen that the direction of acceleration is opposite to the initial velocity, and the slope is 2.", "Therefore,the acceleration is $-2 m/s^{2} $.
