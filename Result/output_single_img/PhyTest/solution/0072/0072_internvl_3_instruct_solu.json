  ["The radar emits radio waves with each emission lasting 1μs and the interval between two emissions being 100μs.", "The speed of light in a vacuum is c=3.0×10^8 m/s.", "The distance between the obstacle and the radar can be calculated using the formula d = (c * t) / 2, where t is the time taken for the wave to travel to the obstacle and back.", "The time taken for the wave to travel to the obstacle and back is equal to the interval between two emissions, which is 100μs.", "Substituting the values into the formula, we get d = (3.0×10^8 m/s * 100×10^-6 s) / 2 = 1.5×10^4 m.", "However, since ab = bc in the figure, the actual distance is half of this value, which is 7.5×10^3 m."]
