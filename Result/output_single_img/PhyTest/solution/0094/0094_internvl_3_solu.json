  ["The ball moves along a straight line at an angle Î¸ to the opposite direction of the electric field, indicating that the net force is along this line.", "The forces acting on the ball are gravity and the electric force.", "The electric force must balance the component of gravity perpendicular to the path to maintain straight-line motion.", "The component of the initial velocity along the direction of motion is \( v_0 \cos \theta \).", "At the highest point, the vertical component of the velocity is zero.", "The kinetic energy at the highest point is \( \frac{1}{2} m (v_0 \cos \theta)^2 \).", "The change in electric potential energy equals the change in kinetic energy along the path.", "The difference in electric potential energy is \( \frac{1}{2} m v_0^2 \cos^2 \theta \)."]
