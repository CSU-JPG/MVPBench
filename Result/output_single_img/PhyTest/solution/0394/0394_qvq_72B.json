[
\left(P + \frac{a}{V^2}\right)(V - b) = RT
\]

where:

- \(P\) is the pressure,

- \(V\) is the molar volume,

- \(T\) is the temperature,

- \(R\) is the ideal gas constant,

- \(a\) and \(b\) are constants specific to the gas.

The critical point occurs when the gas and liquid phases become indistinguishable, which mathematically corresponds to an inflection point in the \(P-V\) isotherm where the first and second derivatives are zero.

But according to the key steps provided, there's a different approach. It mentions that at the critical values, the straight line disappears, implying that the equation of state has a triple root at the critical volume \(V_c\). So, the equation can be expressed as:

\[
P_c (V - V_c)^3 = 0
\]

This seems like a cubic equation in \(V\), and comparing it with the van der Waals equation rearranged in terms of \(V\), we can set up equations to solve for \(a\) and \(b\) in terms of \(P_c\) and \(T_c\).

Let me try to rearrange the van der Waals equation to a cubic form in \(V\). First, expand the left side:

\[
P(V - b) + \frac{a}{V^2}(V - b) = RT
\]

\[
P V - P b + \frac{a}{V^2} V - \frac{a}{V^2} b = RT
\]

\[
P V - P b + \frac{a}{V} - \frac{a b}{V^2} = RT
\]
