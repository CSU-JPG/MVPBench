{-3} \) m³

- Temperature, \( t_A = 27^\circ \)C, which is \( t_A = 27 + 273.15 = 300 \) K

- At point C:

- Pressure, \( p_C = 2 \times 10^5 \) Pa

- Volume, \( v_C = 3 \times 10^{-3} \) m³

- Temperature, \( t_C \)? (This is what we need to find)

Since it's an ideal gas, we can use the ideal gas law, which is \( pv = nRT \), where \( n \) is the number of moles and \( R \) is the ideal gas constant.

But since the mass of the gas doesn't change, the number of moles \( n \) remains constant. Therefore, we can relate the states A and C using the equation:

\[
\frac{p_A v_A}{t_A} = \frac{p_C v_C}{t_C}
\]

Plugging in the known values:

\[
\frac{(3 \times 10^5)(2 \times 10^{-3})}{300} = \frac{(2 \times 10^5)(3 \times 10^{-3})}{t_C}
\]

Simplifying both sides:

Left side:

\[
\frac{6 \times 10^2}{300} = \frac{600}{300} = 2
\]

Right side:

\[
\frac{6 \times 10^2}{t_C} = \frac{600}{t_C}
\]

So, we have:

\[
2 = \frac{600}{t_C}
\]
