{\text{child}} \times g = 30 \, \text{kg} \times 10 \, \text{m/s}^2 = 300 \, \text{N} \) downward.

2. Weight of the sled: \( m_{\text{sled}} \times g = 10 \, \text{kg} \times 10 \, \text{m/s}^2 = 100 \, \text{N} \) downward.

3. The pulling force \( F = 100 \, \text{N} \) at an angle of 37 degrees above the horizontal.

4. The normal force \( N \) exerted by the ground upwards.

Since the sled is moving at a constant speed, the net force in both the horizontal and vertical directions is zero.

Let's break down the pulling force into its horizontal and vertical components.

The horizontal component of the pulling force is \( F \cos \theta = 100 \times \cos 37^\circ = 100 \times 0.8 = 80 \, \text{N}
