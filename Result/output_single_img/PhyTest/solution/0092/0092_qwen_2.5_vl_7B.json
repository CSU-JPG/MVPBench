  ["The net force in the vertical direction must be zero because the sled moves at a constant speed.", "The frictional force acting on the sled is equal to the component of the applied force in the horizontal direction.", "The normal force exerted by the ground on the sled is equal to the weight of the sled plus the weight of the child.", "The pressure exerted by the sled on the ground is the normal force divided by the area of contact between the sled and the ground."]
