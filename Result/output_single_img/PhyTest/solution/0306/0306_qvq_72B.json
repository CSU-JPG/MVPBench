{5}\) Pa and the volume is \(2 \times 10^{-3}\) m³. In state B, the pressure is \(2 \times 10^{5}\) Pa and the volume is \(5 \times 10^{-3}\) m³. I know the temperature in state C is 300K, and I need to find the temperature in state B.

Since it's an ideal gas, I can use the ideal gas law, which is \(PV = nRT\), where P is pressure, V is volume, n is the number of moles, R is the ideal gas constant, and T is temperature. But since the mass of the gas is constant (no mention of adding or removing gas), n is constant.

Given that, if I have two different states, I can relate their P, V, and T using the equation:

\[\frac{P_{B}V_{B}}{T_{B}} = \frac{P_{C}V_{C}}{T_{C}}\]

This is what step 3 mentions. So, plugging in the known values:

\[\frac{(2 \times 10^{5}) \times (5 \times 10^{-3})}{T_{B}} = \frac{(5 \times 10^{5}) \times (2 \times 10^{-3})}{300}\]

Let me calculate both sides:

First, calculate \(P_{B}V_{B}\):

\[(2 \times 10^{5}) \times (5 \times 10^{-3}) = 1000\]
