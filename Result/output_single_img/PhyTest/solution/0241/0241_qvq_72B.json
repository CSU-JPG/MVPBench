[q v B = m \frac{v^2}{r}\]

Solving for \(r\), I get:

\[r = \frac{m v}{q B}\]

Interesting, the radius is inversely proportional to the magnetic field strength. Since \(B_1 = 2 B_2\), the radius in \(B_1\) should be half of that in \(B_2\). So, \(r_1 = \frac{m v}{q B_1}\) and \(r_2 = \frac{m v}{q B_2}\), and thus \(r_1 : r_2 = 1 : 2\).

Next, I need to think about the time periods in each field. The time period \(T\) for one complete circle is given by:

\[T = \frac{2 \pi r}{v} = \frac{2 \pi m}{q B}\]

So, \(T_1 = \frac{2 \pi m}{q B_1}\) and \(T_2 = \frac{2 \pi m}{q B_2}
