[ a = \frac{dv}{dt} \]

So, if I integrate acceleration over time, I should get the change in velocity. In fact, the area under the acceleration-time graph gives me the change in velocity from the initial state.

Given that the body starts from rest, its initial velocity \( v_0 = 0 \). Therefore, the velocity at any time \( t \) is just the area under the acceleration-time curve from time 0 to time \( t \).

Let me look at the graph. It's an a-t graph with time in seconds on the x-axis and acceleration in \( m/s^2 \) on the y-axis. From time \( t = 0 \) to \( t = 1 \) s, the acceleration is constant at \( a = 2 \) \( m/s^2 \). From \( t = 1 \) s to \( t = 3 \) s, the acceleration decreases linearly to \( a = -2 \) \( m/s^2 \), and then remains constant at \( a = -2 \) \( m/s^2 \) from \( t = 3 \) s to \( t = 4 \) s.

I need to find the time when the velocity is maximum. Since velocity is the integral of acceleration, I should calculate the cumulative area under the acceleration curve and find the point where this cumulative area is maximum.

Let me divide the time intervals and calculate the area in each segment.

1. From \( t = 0 \) to \( t = 1 \) s:

The acceleration is constant at \( a = 2 \) \( m/s^2 \).

The area under the curve in this interval is:

\[ \text{area}_1 = a \times t = 2 \, m/s^2 \times 1 \, s = 2 \, m/s \]
