[
\mathcal{E} = -\frac{d\Phi_B}{dt}

Since the magnetic field is uniform and perpendicular to the loop, the magnetic flux \(\Phi_B\) is:

\[
\Phi_B = B \cdot A
\]

where \(A\) is the area of the part of the loop that is inside the magnetic field.

Given that the loop is entering the field uniformly at speed \(v\), the area \(A\) is a function of time, and we can express it in terms of the position of the loop.

But wait, the key reasoning steps mention that the effective cutting length is the red-colored line in the figure, and its maximum length is \(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
