{3} \) cm and a diameter of \( L = 40 \) cm opened on a horizontal roof. Then, a glass brick with the same shape and thickness is embedded in this light hole. The refractive index of the glass brick is \( n = \sqrt{3} \). We're supposed to find out by how much the range of light incident on the central point at the bottom of the light-transmitting hole increases compared to before embedding the glass brick.

First, I need to understand the setup. There's a light hole in the roof, and light is coming through it. When there's no glass brick, light directly enters the room and hits the central point at the bottom. When we embed the glass brick, the light has to pass through the glass, which will refract the light, changing its direction. This refraction will affect the range of light that reaches the central point.

So, the problem is essentially asking for the difference in the range of incident light angles before and after embedding the glass brick.

Let's break this down into steps:

1. **Without the glass brick:**

- Light passes directly through the air.

- The range of incident light angles depends on the geometry of the light hole and the central point.

- Assuming the central point is directly below the center of the light hole, the range of incident angles would be determined by the geometry of the hole and the distance to the central point.

2. **With the glass brick:**

- Light passes through the glass brick, which refracts the light.

- We need to consider the refraction at the air-glass interface.

- Using Snell's law: \( n = \frac{\sin i}{\sin r} \), where \( i \) is the angle of incidence and \( r \) is the angle of refraction.

Given that the refractive index \( n = \sqrt{3} \), and from the key step, it mentions that the refraction angle \( r = 30^\circ \). Let's use Snell's law to find the angle of incidence \( i \).

So, \( n = \frac{\sin i}{\sin r} \)

Plugging in the values:

\( \sqrt{3} = \frac{\sin i}{\sin 30^\circ}
