[
\sin C = \frac{1}{n}
\]

where n is the refractive index of the medium.

So, the smaller the refractive index, the larger the critical angle, and vice versa.

Now, the key steps provided are:

1. For the two beams of light entering at the right-angle side with the same angle of incidence i, the angles of refraction are r1 < r2. By Snell's law, n_a < n_b.

2. Since \sin C = \frac{1}{n}
