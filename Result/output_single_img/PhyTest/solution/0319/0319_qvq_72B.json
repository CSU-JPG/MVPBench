{P_A V_A}{T_A} = \frac{P_C V_C}{T_C}\), and from that, \(T_C = 300\) K is obtained.

2. Because the temperature of state A and state C are equal, the internal energy change \(\Delta U = 0\) for the process A to C, since for an ideal gas, internal energy depends only on temperature. Then, from the first law of thermodynamics, \(\Delta U = Q + W\), so \(Q = -W\).

3. From B to C, the volume increases, so the gas does work on the surroundings. The work done by the gas during this constant pressure process is \(W = -P_B \Delta V = -200\) J.

Okay, let's verify these steps one by one.

First, from A to C via B, we have a path A to B isothermal (since volume constant and pressure changes, but temperature might change), and B to C is isobaric (constant pressure, volume increases).

But according to the first key step, using the ideal gas law, \(\frac{P_A V_A}{T_A}
