{-3} \) m³. Similarly, at point A, pressure is \( p_a = 3 \times 10^5 \) Pa and volume is \( v_a = 1 \times 10^{-3} \) m³. The temperature at point A is given as 27°C, which is 300 K in Kelvin.

So, the gas starts at point A, goes to point B, and then to point C. I need to understand the path it takes and how that affects the heat transfer.

Step 1: Find the temperature at point C.

Using the ideal gas equation, \( \frac{p_a v_a}{t_a} = \frac{p_c v_c}{t_c} \), where t is temperature in Kelvin. Plugging in the values:

\( \frac{(3 \times 10^5)(1 \times 10^{-3})}{300} = \frac{(1 \times 10^5)(3 \times 10^{-3})}{t_c} \)

Simplify both sides:

Left side: \( \frac{300}{300} = 1 \)

Right side: \( \frac{300}{t_c} \)

So, \( 1 = \frac{300}{t_c}
