{\sqrt{3}}{3}R\) from point O, where R is the radius of the semi-cylinder. At this position, no more light rays are emitted from the right side of the transparent object. Our goal is to find the refractive index of the transparent object for this monochromatic light.

First, I need to understand the setup. We have a semi-cylinder, so it's like half a cylinder, with a flat side and a curved side. Point O is likely the center of the flat side, and point A is one end of the diameter, making OA the axis of the semi-cylinder. The light is initially along OA, which is the axis, and then it's moved to point C, which is at a distance \(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}R\) from O.

Since no more light rays are emitted from the right side at this position, it suggests that the light is undergoing total internal reflection at some point inside the semi-cylinder. Total internal reflection occurs when the angle of incidence exceeds the critical angle, and the light doesn't pass through the boundary but reflects back into the medium.

So, to find the refractive index, I need to relate it to the critical angle. The critical angle \(C\) is given by Snell's Law:

\[
\sin C = \frac{1}{n}
\]

where \(n\) is the refractive index of the medium.

Now, I need to find the angle of incidence that corresponds to the critical angle in this scenario. The problem mentions that the light is moved to point C at a distance \(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}
