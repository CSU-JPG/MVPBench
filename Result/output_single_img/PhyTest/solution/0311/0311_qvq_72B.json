[PV = nRT\]

Where:

- \(P\) is the pressure

- \(V\) is the volume

- \(n\) is the number of moles

- \(R\) is the ideal gas constant

- \(T\) is the temperature

Since the mass of the gas is constant, \(n\) is also constant.

Looking at points A and B:

- At point A: \(P_A = p_0\), \(T_A = T_0\), \(V_A = V_0\)

- At point B: \(P_B = ?\), \(T_B = T_0\), \(V_B = 2V_0\)

Wait, according to the description, the line segment AB is parallel to the V axis, meaning that the temperature remains constant while the volume increases from \(V_0\) to \(2V_0\). But the temperature at point B is given as \(T_0\), same as at point A. So, it's an isothermal process from A to B.

But hold on, in an isothermal process, if temperature remains constant, then according to the ideal gas law:

\[P V = \text{constant}\]

So, if volume increases by a factor of 2, pressure should decrease by a factor of 2 to keep the product \(P V\) constant.

Therefore:

\[P_B = \frac{P_A \cdot V_A}{V_B} = \frac{p_0 \cdot V_0}{2V_0} = \frac{p_0}{2}\]

So, at point B, \(P_B = \frac{p_0}{2}
