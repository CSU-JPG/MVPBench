{p_a v_a}{t_a} = \frac{p_d v_d}{t_d}\), because \(n\) and \(r\) are constants.

Plugging in the known values:

\(\frac{p_1 \cdot v_1}{t_0} = \frac{p_1 \cdot v_2}{t_d}\)

I can simplify this equation to solve for \(t_d\).

First, notice that \(p_1\) appears on both sides, so they cancel out:

\(\frac{v_1}{t_0}
