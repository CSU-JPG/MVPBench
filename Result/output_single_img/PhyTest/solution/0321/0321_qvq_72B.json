{-3} \) m³. The temperature in state A is given as 27°C, which I need to convert to Kelvin because the ideal gas law uses Kelvin temperatures. So, \( T_A = 27 + 273.15 = 300 \) K.

Next, in state B, the pressure is \( P_B = 2 \times 10^5 \) Pa and the volume is \( V_B = 6 \times 10^{-3} \) m³. The question is asking for the temperature in state B, which is \( T_B \).

Since it's an ideal gas, we can use the ideal gas equation to relate pressure, volume, and temperature. The equation is:

\[
\frac{P V}{T} = n R
\]

Where \( n \) is the number of moles of the gas and \( R \) is the ideal gas constant. For a given mass of gas, \( n \) is constant, so:

\[
\frac{P V}{T} = \text{constant}
\]

This means that if we know the pressure and volume at two different states, we can set up a ratio to find the unknown temperature.

So, starting from state A to state B, we have:

\[
\frac{P_A \times V_A}{T_A} = \frac{P_B \times V_B}{T_B}
\]

Plugging in the known values:

\[
\frac{(1 \times 10^5) \times (6 \times 10^{-3})}{300} = \frac{(2 \times 10^5) \times (6 \times 10^{-3})}{T_B}
\]

Let's simplify both sides:

Left side:

\[
(1 \times 10^5) \times (6 \times 10^{-3}
