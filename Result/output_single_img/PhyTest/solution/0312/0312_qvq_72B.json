[
PV = nRT
\]

where:

- \( P \) is pressure

- \( V \) is volume

- \( n \) is the amount of gas (in moles)

- \( R \) is the ideal gas constant

- \( T \) is temperature (in Kelvin)

Since the mass of the gas is constant, \( n \) remains the same throughout the cycle.

The problem mentions that each state is in equilibrium, which is important for applying the ideal gas law.

We are given \( T_A = 27^\circ \mathrm{C} \). To use the ideal gas law, we need to convert this to Kelvin:

\[
T_A (\text{Kelvin}) = 27 + 273.15 = 300.15 \text{ K}
\]

Now, we have:

At state A:

\[
P_A = 1 \times 10^5 \text{ Pa}
\]

\[
V_A = 3 \text{ L} = 0.003 \text{ m}^3
\]

\[
T_A = 300.15 \text{ K}
\]
