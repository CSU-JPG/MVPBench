[ v^2 = 2 a x \]

where:

- \( v \) is the velocity,

- \( a \) is the acceleration,

- \( x \) is the displacement.

Looking at the graph provided, it plots \( v^2 \) (in m²/s²) against \( x \) (in meters). There are two lines, one for car A and one for car B, both starting from the origin.

From the equation \( v^2 = 2 a x \), I can see that the slope of the line in this graph is equal to \( 2 a \). So, if I can compare the slopes of the lines for A and B, I can determine which car has the greater acceleration.

Let me look at the graph again. At a displacement of 0.5 meters, both lines intersect at a point where \( v^2 = 2 \) m²/s². From there, I can see that car A has a steeper slope compared to car B.

Wait, actually, the slope of the line is the change in \( v^2 \) over the change in \( x \). From the origin to the point (0.5, 2), I can calculate the slope for each car.

For car A:

Slope A = \(\frac{2 - 0}{0.5 - 0} = 4\) m²/s² per meter = 4 m²/s²·m⁻¹

For car B:

Slope B = \(\frac{2 - 1}{0.5 - 0}
