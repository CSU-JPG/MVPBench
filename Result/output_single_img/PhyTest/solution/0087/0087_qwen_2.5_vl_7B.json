  ["The wooden rod is released from rest and falls freely under gravity.", "The height of the cylinder is 5 meters, so the rod needs to travel 5 meters to reach the top of the cylinder.", "The time \( t \) it takes for the rod to fall a distance \( h \) under free fall is given by \( t = \sqrt{\frac{2h}{g}} \).", "Substitute \( h = 5 \) meters and \( g = 10 \) m/sÂ² into the equation to find the time to reach the top of the cylinder.", "Calculate the time to reach the top of the cylinder.", "The time \( t_1 \) for the rod to pass through the upper end \( A \) of the cylinder is the time to reach the top of the cylinder minus the time it takes for the lower end of the rod to enter the cylinder.", "Calculate the time \( t_1 \) using the derived formula."]
