{R}{2}\) is removed from \(M\), and we need to find the gravitational force \(F\) exerted by the remaining part on the particle.

First, I need to recall some principles of gravitational forces. The gravitational force between two point masses is given by Newton's law of gravitation:

\[F = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}\]

where \(G\) is the gravitational constant, \(m_1\) and \(m_2\) are the masses, and \(r\) is the distance between their centers.

However, in this problem, we're dealing with an extended object (the sphere) and a point mass. For spherically symmetric mass distributions, the gravitational force outside the sphere is the same as if all the mass were concentrated at the center. That's a crucial point.

So, initially, before removing the smaller sphere, the gravitational force between the sphere and the point mass would be:

\[F_{\text{initial}} = G \frac{M m}{(2R)^2} = G \frac{M m}{4R^2}\]

But part of the sphere is removed, so the mass contributing to the gravitational force is no longer \(M\). We need to find the mass of the removed sphere and subtract its gravitational effect from the total force.

The removed sphere has a radius of \(\frac{R}{2}\). Since the original sphere is uniformly dense, the mass of the removed sphere can be found using the ratio of their volumes.

The volume of a sphere is \(\frac{4}{3}\pi r^3\). So, the volume of the original sphere is:

\[V = \frac{4}{3}\pi R^3\]

The volume of the removed sphere is:

\[V_{\text{removed}} = \frac{4}{3}\pi \left(\frac{R}{2}\right)^3 = \frac{4}{3}\pi \frac{R^3}{8} = \frac{1}{8} \times \frac{4}{3}\pi R^3 = \frac{1}{8} V\]
