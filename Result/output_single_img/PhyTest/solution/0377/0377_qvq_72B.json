{\sqrt{3}}{2}R\), and DE is \(\sqrt{2}R\). We need to find the refractive index of the medium, and the answer is supposed to be \(\frac{\sqrt{6}}{2}\).

First, I need to visualize the setup. There's a hemisphere with base AC, center O, and the light enters at D on the arc, which is part of the curved surface. Since it's entering from air (I assume refractive index 1), it will refract at point E on the arc surface, and then again at some point F on the base AC.

Wait, the problem says "after refracting at point E on the arc surface, the light is refracted again and hits point F on the ground (both \( E, F \) are not labeled)."

Hmm, so the light enters at D, refracts at E, and then again at F. But in the key steps, it's mentioned that we need to draw the light path diagram based on the problem and use geometric relationships to find angles.

Looking at the key steps:

1. Draw the light path diagram according to the problem. Based on geometric relationships, it's known that \( i = 60^\circ \), \( \sin i = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \).

2. From mathematical knowledge, \( r = 45^\circ \), \( \sin r = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \).

3. Therefore, \( n = \frac{\sin i}{\sin r} = \frac{\sqrt{3}/2}{\sqrt{2}/2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{6}}{2} \).

4. Hence, the refractive index is \( \frac{\sqrt{6}}{2} \).

So, the refractive index is calculated using Snell's Law: \( n = \frac{\sin i}{\sin r}
