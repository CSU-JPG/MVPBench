{-3}\) m³, and state A has a pressure of \(3 \times 10^5\) Pa and a volume of \(3 \times 10^{-3}\) m³. The temperature at state C is 300 K, and we need to find the temperature at state A.

Since it's an ideal gas, we can use the ideal gas law, which is \(PV = nRT\), where P is pressure, V is volume, n is the number of moles, R is the ideal gas constant, and T is temperature.

But in this problem, the mass of the gas is constant, so n is constant. Therefore, we can use the combined gas law: \(\frac{P_1 V_1}{T_1} = \frac{P_2 V_2}{T_2}\).

Given that, we can set up the equation with states A and C:

\(\frac{P_A V_A}{T_A} = \frac{P_C V_C}{T_C}\)

Plugging in the known values:

\(\frac{(3 \times 10^5) \times (3 \times 10^{-3})}{T_A} = \frac{(5 \times 10^5) \times (2 \times 10^{-3})}{300}\)

Let's calculate the right side first:

\((5 \times 10^5) \times (2 \times 10^{-3}) = 1000 \times 2 = 2000\)

Wait, no, that's not right. Let's recalculate:

\(5 \times 10^5 \times 2 \times 10^{-3} = (5 \times 2) \times (10^5 \times 10^{-3}) = 10 \times 10^{5-3}
