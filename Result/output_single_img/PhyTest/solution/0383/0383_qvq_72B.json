{m g r}{B^{2} l} \), and there are three key steps provided. I need to figure out all the possible valid reasoning chains that lead from the question to this answer using these steps in a logical order.

First, let's understand what's going on here. There's a conductor rod MN moving vertically downward between two rails AB and CD, which are connected at one end with DE, forming an isosceles right triangle BDE. There's a uniform magnetic field B perpendicular to the plane of the rails. The distance between the rails is l, and the height difference between MN and BD is also l. The rod has mass m and resistance per unit length r. It's released from rest and reaches a constant speed before arriving at BD.

Since it's moving at a constant speed, that means the forces acting on it are balanced. So, there must be an upward force due to the magnetic field opposing the downward force of gravity.

The key steps are:

1. When the conductor rod moves at a constant velocity, according to the equilibrium condition, we have \( m g = B I l \).

2. Therefore, we can obtain \( I = \frac{B l v}{l r} \).

3. Solving simultaneously, we obtain \( v = \frac{m g r}{B^{2} l} \).

Okay, so step 1 is about the equilibrium condition, step 2 is about finding the current I, and step 3 is combining the two to find v.

Let me think about the order. It seems like step 1 is using the equilibrium condition to relate mg, B, I, and l. Step 2 is expressing I in terms of v, B, l, and r. Then step 3 is solving for v by combining these two equations.

So one possible chain is step 1 first, then step 2, then step 3.

But maybe there are other ways to arrange these steps logically.

Let's consider step 2 first. It says \( I = \frac{B l v}{l r} \). Wait, that simplifies to \( I = \frac{B v}{r}
