{H - h}{H + h}\). I need to find the ratio of the post-collision velocity to the pre-collision velocity.

Let me recall some basic physics principles. When the ball is falling, its potential energy is converted to kinetic energy. Just before it hits the ground, its velocity can be found using the conservation of energy, considering air resistance.

But air resistance is complicating. The problem states that the air resistance is \(\lambda\) times the gravitational force, so \(F_{\text{air}} = \lambda mg\), where \(m\) is the mass of the ball, and \(g\) is the gravitational acceleration.

During the fall, the net force is \(mg - F_{\text{air}} = mg - \lambda mg = mg(1 - \lambda)\). According to Newton's second law, \(F = ma\), so the acceleration during the fall is \(a_{\text{down}} = g(1 - \lambda)\).

Similarly, during the rise, the forces are \(mg\) downward and \(F_{\text{air}}\) downward, so the net force is \(mg + \lambda mg = mg(1 + \lambda)\), and the acceleration during the rise is \(a_{\text{up}}
