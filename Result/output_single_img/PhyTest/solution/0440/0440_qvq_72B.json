{AB}{NS} = \sqrt{3}\), and there are some key steps provided. I need to make sure I understand these steps and how they connect to get to the final answer.

First, let's try to visualize the setup. There's a wedge-shaped glass with a top angle of 30 degrees. That means the angle at the apex is 30 degrees, right? So, if I imagine the cross-section, it would look like a triangle with one angle of 30 degrees at the top, and the other two angles would be equal, say each is \( \frac{180 - 30}{2} = 75 \) degrees.

There's a light source S on one side, and the light is refracted at an angle of 45 degrees when it enters the glass perpendicular to one of the sides. I need to figure out which side the light is entering and how it's being refracted.

Looking at the diagram mentioned, there are points O, P, Q, N, and S. The light is coming from S towards N, and there's a 45-degree angle indicated somewhere. Since the light is entering perpendicular to one side, that means the incident angle is 0 degrees, but wait, if it's perpendicular, the angle of incidence should be 90 degrees, right? Maybe I need to understand this better.

Let me look at the first key step:

"key_step_1": Let the incident angle at the interface OQ be \(\alpha\) and the refraction angle be \(\beta\), with \(\alpha = 30^\circ\) and \(n = \frac{\sin{\beta}}{\sin{\alpha}} = \sqrt{2}\).

Hmm, this seems to be referring to Snell's Law, which relates the angles of incidence and refraction through the refractive indices of the two media. The formula is \( n = \frac{\sin{\alpha}}{\sin{\beta}}
