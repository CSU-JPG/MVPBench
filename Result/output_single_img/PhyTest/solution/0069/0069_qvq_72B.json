{~V} \). The switch was originally closed, and at time \( t_1 = 1.0 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{~s} \), it was opened. The graph shows the current through the coil before and after this moment.

First, I need to understand the circuit diagram. There's a lamp, a coil \( L \), a resistor \( R \), and a switch \( S \), all connected in some configuration between points A and B, which are connected to a voltage source. The switch was closed, and then at a certain time, it was opened, causing the current through the coil to decay over time, as shown in the graph.

From the graph, I can see that the current starts at about 1.5 A and decays exponentially to zero. This decay is due to the self-inductance of the coil when the switch is opened, creating an induced emf that opposes the change in current.

I should recall the behavior of an RL circuit during the discharge phase. When the switch is opened, the energy stored in the inductor is dissipated through the resistances in the circuit.

Let me think about the circuit when the switch is closed. Assuming steady state, the inductor acts like a short circuit because it opposes any change in current. So, the current through the inductor should be stable before the switch is opened.

Wait, but looking at the circuit diagram, it seems like when the switch is closed, the lamp, the coil, and the resistor \( R \) are in parallel across points A and B, which are connected to the voltage source. But I need to confirm the exact configuration.

Given that points A and B are connected to a voltage source of \( U = 6.0 \mathrm{~V}
