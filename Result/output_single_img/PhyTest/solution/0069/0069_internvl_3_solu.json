  ["The circuit is in a steady state before the switch is opened, meaning the current through the coil is constant.", "The total resistance in the circuit before the switch is opened is the sum of the lamp resistance and the fixed resistor.", "Using Ohm's Law, the current in the circuit before the switch is opened can be calculated.", "The current through the coil before the switch is opened is equal to the total voltage divided by the total resistance.", "The current through the coil before the switch is opened is 1.5 A.", "The total resistance in the circuit before the switch is opened is 4.0 Ω.", "The resistance of the coil can be found by subtracting the known resistances from the total resistance.", "The resistance of the coil is 2.0 Ω."]
