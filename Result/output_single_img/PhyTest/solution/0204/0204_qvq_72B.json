{U}{d}\).

- The electric field force is \(F_e = qE = q \frac{U}{d}\), acting horizontally (assuming the plates create a horizontal field).

The resultant force along \(BC\) is at 45 degrees to the vertical, so the horizontal and vertical components of this resultant force should be equal.

Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[\tan 45^\circ = \frac{\text{horizontal component}}{\text{vertical component}} = \frac{F_e}{G}\]

Since \(\tan 45^\circ = 1\), we have:

\[1 = \frac{F_e}{G} \implies F_e = G\]

Substituting \(F_e = q \frac{U}{d}\), we get:

\[q \frac{U}{d} = G \implies q = \frac{G d}{U}\]
