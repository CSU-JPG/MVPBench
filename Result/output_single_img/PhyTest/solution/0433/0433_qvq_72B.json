{2}\). There's a point O inside this body, and light is traveling from O to the AB boundary. The angle of incidence at point O is 45 degrees. We need to find the time \(t\) it takes for the light to travel from point O to the AB boundary.

First, I need to understand the geometry here. We have a right-angled trapezoid, with right angles probably at points A and E, since it's labeled ABDE. Point O is inside, and light is traveling towards the AB boundary at an angle of 45 degrees.

Given that the refractive index \(n = \sqrt{2}\), I can use Snell's law to find the refraction angle when the light enters the AB boundary.

Snell's law states that \(n_1 \sin \theta_1 = n_2 \sin \theta_2\), where \(n_1\) is the refractive index of the initial medium, \(\theta_1\) is the angle of incidence, \(n_2\) is the refractive index of the final medium, and \(\theta_2\) is the angle of refraction.

In this case, the light is going from the transparent body (with \(n_1 = \sqrt{2}\)) to air (let's assume \(n_2 = 1\)), and the angle of incidence \(\theta_1 = 45^\circ\).

So, plugging into Snell's law:

\(\sqrt{2} \times \sin 45^\circ = 1 \times \sin \theta_2\)

I know that \(\sin 45^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\), so:

\(\sqrt{2} \times \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = \sin \theta_2\)

Simplifying:

\(\frac{2}{2}
