["The wooden block undergoes uniform acceleration in the interval from $0$ to $0.5 \mathrm{s}$.", "The acceleration of the uniform acceleration motion is: $a_{1} = \frac{\Delta v_{1}}{\Delta t_{1}} = \frac{2}{0.5} = 4 \mathrm{m/s^{2}}$.", "According to Newton's second law, we have: $\mu_{1}mg = ma_{1}$.", "Solving for $\mu_{1}$, we get: $\mu_{1} = 0.4$."]
