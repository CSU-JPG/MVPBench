{2} \). I need to determine the refraction angle when the light enters the prism and then see if it can exit from edge CD.

First, I need to understand the geometry of the Dawes prism. It's derived from an isosceles right-angle prism, and it has angles of 45 degrees at bases C and D. Since it's cut parallel to the base, edge AB is parallel to CD. The light enters through AC, which is one of the sides, and it's entering parallel to the base CD.

I recall that Snell's law relates the angles of incidence and refraction for light passing through the interface of two different media. The formula is:

\[ n_1 \sin \theta_1 = n_2 \sin \theta_2 \]

In this case, the light is entering from air into glass, so \( n_1 = 1 \) (air), and \( n_2 = \sqrt{2} \) (glass). The angle of incidence is the angle between the ray and the normal to the surface. Since the ray is entering through AC, which is at 45 degrees to the base, I think the angle of incidence is 45 degrees.

Wait, but I need to confirm that. If the ray is parallel to the base CD and enters through AC, which is at 45 degrees to the base, then the angle between the ray and the normal to AC would indeed be 45 degrees. So, \( \theta_1 = 45^\circ \).

Using Snell's law:

\[ 1 \cdot \sin 45^\circ = \sqrt{2} \cdot \sin \theta_2 \]

\[ \sin 45^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \]

\[ \sin \theta_2 = \frac{\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{1}{2} \]
