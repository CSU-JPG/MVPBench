{U_1}{U_2} = \frac{n_1}{n_2} \) and \( \frac{U_1}{U_3} = \frac{n_1}{n_3} \), where \( U_1 \) is the primary voltage, \( U_2 \) and \( U_3 \) are the secondary voltages, and \( n_1, n_2, n_3 \) are the number of turns in the primary and secondary coils, respectively.

But in this problem, I don't know \( n_2 \) and \( n_3 \). However, I do know the voltages and powers for the appliances connected to the secondary coils. Maybe I can use the power information to find the currents in the secondary coils and then relate that to the primary current.

Let's consider the first appliance: 6V 20W. The power is 20W at 6V, so the current in the secondary coil for this appliance would be \( I_2 = \frac{P_2}{U_2} = \frac{20W}{6V} = \frac{10}{3} A \) or approximately 3.33A.

Similarly, for the second appliance: 110V 60W. The power is 60W at 110V, so the current in the secondary coil for this appliance is \( I_3 = \frac{P_3}{U_3} = \frac{60W}{110V} = \frac{6}{11}
