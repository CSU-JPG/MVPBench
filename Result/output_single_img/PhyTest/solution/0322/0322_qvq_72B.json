{-3} \) m³

- At state A: \( p_a = 1 \times 10^5 \) Pa and \( v_a = 6 \times 10^{-3} \) m³

- Using the ideal gas law: \( \frac{p_a v_a}{t_a} = \frac{p_c v_c}{t_c} \), and given that \( t_a = 27^\circ c = 300 \) K, we find \( t_c = 300 \) K.

- From A to C, the volume decreases, and the work done by the surroundings on the gas is calculated as \( w = \frac{(p_b + p_c)(v_b - v_c)}{2}
