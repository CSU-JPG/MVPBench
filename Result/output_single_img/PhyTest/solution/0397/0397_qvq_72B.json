{\min } = \frac{2 q B}{m}\), and there are some key steps provided. I need to understand how these steps connect to get to the final answer.

First, let's make sure I understand the setup. There are two small balls, each with mass \(m\), carrying charges \(+q\) and \(-q\), connected by a rigid, massless rod of length \(d\). This dipole is in the XY-plane, and there's a uniform magnetic field \(\vec{B}\) perpendicular to this plane. Initially, the dipole is aligned with the X-axis, has an initial angular velocity \(\omega_0\) in the XY-plane, and its center of mass is at the origin with initial velocity \(\vec{v}_0\) parallel to the XY-plane. But it's given that \(\vec{v}_0 = 0\), so the center of mass is stationary.

The goal is to find the minimal \(\omega_0\) (\(\omega_{\min }\)) such that the dipole can reverse its orientation during its motion. Reversing orientation means that the dipole moment \(\vec{p}\) changes direction from \(\vec{p}_0\) to \(-\vec{p}_0\).

Looking at the key steps:

**Key Step 1:**

The net force on the dipole is given by:

\[\vec{F} = 2 q (\vec{\omega} \times \vec{r}) \times \vec{B} = (\vec{\omega} \times \vec{p}) \times \vec{B}\]

And it mentions that the time derivative of the dipole moment is:

\[\frac{d\vec{p}}{dt} = \vec{\omega} \times \vec{p}\]

Using Newton's second law:

\[2 m \frac{d\vec{v}}{dt} = \vec{F} = \frac{d\vec{p}}{dt} \times \vec{B}\]

Integrating, we get a conserved quantity:

\[2 m \vec{v}
