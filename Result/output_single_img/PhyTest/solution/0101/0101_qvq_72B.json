[F = \mu_2 (m_A + m_B) g\]

This makes sense because the entire system is on the verge of slipping to the left, and the frictional force opposing this motion is \(\mu_2 (m_A + m_B) g\).

From key step 2:

For the force analysis of object B in the vertical direction, we have:

\[\mu_1 \times F = m_B \times g\]

This suggests that the frictional force between A and B, which is \(\mu_1\) times the normal force between them, is equal to \(m_B g\). Since B is on the verge of sliding down, the frictional force is at its maximum, opposing the downward slide.

Now, I need to relate these two equations to find the mass ratio \(\frac{m_A}{m_B}\).

From key step 3:

By solving these two equations simultaneously, we can find the mass ratio.

Let's plug the expression for \(F\) from key step 1 into key step 2.

From key step 1:

\[F = \mu_2 (m_A + m_B) g\]

From key step 2:

\[\mu_1 F = m_B g\]
