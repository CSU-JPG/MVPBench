{Q}{U}\), where \(U\) is the potential difference.

So, if I rearrange that formula, I get \(U = \frac{Q}{C}\). That makes sense. Now, the electric field \(E\) between the plates can be expressed in terms of the potential difference and the distance. I recall that for parallel plates, the electric field is uniform and can be calculated as \(E = \frac{U}{d}\).

Given that, I can substitute \(U\) from the first equation into this one to get \(E = \frac{Q}{C d}\). That seems straightforward.

Now, there's a point charge \(q\) placed at the midpoint between the two plates. The electric field at any point between the plates is uniform and directed from the positive plate to the negative plate. So, at the midpoint, the electric field should still be \(E = \frac{Q}{C d}\), assuming the plates are large enough that edge effects are negligible.

The electrostatic force \(F\) on the point charge \(q\) due to this electric field is given by \(F = q E\). Substituting the expression for \(E\), I get \(F = q \times \frac{Q}{C d} = \frac{Q q}{C d}\).

Looking back at the final answer provided, it matches this: \(F = \frac{Q q}{C d}\). So, that seems correct.

But let me think if there's any other way to approach this problem. Maybe using the formula for the electric field in terms of the charge density and the area of the plates. If I recall correctly, the electric field between the plates can also be expressed as \(E = \frac{\sigma}{\epsilon_0}
