Explanation of Key Reasoning Steps:

1. **Determine the area of the coil**: Calculate the area \( A \) of the rectangular coil using the side lengths \( l_{AB} \) and \( l_{BC} \).

2. **Calculate the magnetic flux**: Use the formula for magnetic flux \( \Phi = B \cdot A \cdot \cos(\omega t) \), where \( B \) is the magnetic field, \( A \) is the area, and \( \omega t \) is the angular position.

3. **Determine the rate of change of magnetic flux**: Differentiate the magnetic flux with respect to time to find the rate of change \( \frac{d\Phi}{dt} \).

4. **Apply Faraday's Law**: Use Faraday's Law of Induction, \( \mathcal{E} = -n \frac{d\Phi}{dt}
