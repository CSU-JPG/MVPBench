  ["The magnetic flux through the coil changes with time due to its rotation.", "The induced electromotive force (EMF) is proportional to the rate of change of magnetic flux.", "The maximum value of the induced EMF can be calculated using Faraday's law.", "The induced EMF has a sinusoidal form because the magnetic flux varies sinusoidally with time.", "The frequency of the induced EMF is related to the angular velocity of the coil.", "The amplitude of the induced EMF is determined by the magnetic induction intensity, the number of turns, and the dimensions of the coil."]
