  ["The equation of motion for the particle can be expressed as $x-x_0=\frac{1}{2} \times a \times t^{2}$, which simplifies to $x=x_0+\frac{1}{2} \times a \times t^{2}$ (note the negative sign indicating motion in the negative direction).", "The acceleration of the particle is equal to twice the absolute value of the slope of the graph divided by 2, $a=6m/s^2$."]
