{1}{n} \), where \( n \) is the refractive index of the fiber.

Now, looking at the key reasoning steps provided:

1. The critical state of light is when the light is incident close to the inner surface, total reflection just happens on the outer surface, and the light path is as shown in the figure, then \( \sin C = \frac{R - \frac{d}{2}}{R + \frac{d}{2}} \).

2. From the relationship between critical angle and refractive index \( \sin C = \frac{1}{n} \), so \( R = \frac{d(n + 1)}{2(n - 1)}
