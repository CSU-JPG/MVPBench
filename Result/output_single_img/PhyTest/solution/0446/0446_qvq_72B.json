{\sqrt{2410}}{30} \), centered at point O.

- There's an isosceles right triangle glass brick SMN, where B is the midpoint of MN, and BO is perpendicular to the hypotenuse.

- The length of BO is \( \frac{R}{4} \), and MN and PQ are parallel and equal in length.

- A beam of monochromatic light enters the glass brick at point A, which is the midpoint of SM, and then passes through points B, C, and D.

- The length of OC is \( \frac{3R}{4} \).

- We need to find the refractive index of the glass brick, denoted as \( n_1 \).

From the key reasoning steps provided:

1. The refraction angle on the MN plane is \( \alpha \), and in the right triangle BOC, \( \sin \alpha = \frac{3\sqrt{10}}{10} \).

2. The refractive index of the glass brick is given by \( n_1 = \frac{\sin \alpha}{\sin 45^\circ} \), leading to \( n_1 = \frac{3\sqrt{5}}{5} \).

My task is to verify and understand the logical chain that connects the given information to the final answer. I need to ensure that each step is logically sound and that there are no missing links.

Let's start by understanding the geometry of the setup.

### Step 1: Understanding the Geometry

- **Hemispherical Medium:** Center O, radius \( R \), refractive index \( \frac{\sqrt{2410}}{30} \).

- **Isosceles Right Triangle Glass Brick SMN:**

  - SM and SN are the legs.

  - MN is the hypotenuse.

  - B is the midpoint of MN.

  - BO is perpendicular to the hypotenuse, length \( \frac{R}{4}
