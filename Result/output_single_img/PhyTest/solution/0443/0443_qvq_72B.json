[ \sin C = \frac{1}{n} \]

where n is the refractive index of the medium from which the light is coming.

In this case, light A is in water, and it's being refracted into air. The refractive index of water for light A is n‚ÇÅ, and the refractive index of air is approximately 1. So, the critical angle for light A is:

\[ \sin C_a = \frac{1}{n_1} \]
