{\sqrt{2}R}{2}\).

- The sum of the distances between points B and Q is 0.26R.

I need to find the refractive index, n, of the glass.

Let me try to visualize this. There's a semi-circle with M at the top, O at the center, and PQ at the base. Light comes in parallel to the base, refracts at point A, travels through the glass, and exits at point B.

I should draw this out to understand the paths better.

First, since the light is entering from the bottom and is parallel to the base, the incident angle at point A is the angle between the light ray and the normal to the surface at A.

The normal at A is along the radius OA. Since the light is coming from below, parallel to the base, the incident angle Î± can be found using trigonometry.

Given that the distance from A to M is \(\frac{\sqrt{2}R}{2}\), and M is the top point, I can use this to find the angle of incidence.

Wait, actually, the distance between A and M is \(\frac{\sqrt{2}R}{2}\), and the radius is R. So, in the semi-circle, the position of A is such that the distance along the arc from O to A corresponds to this distance.

But actually, the distance between points A and M is along the curve, right? Wait, no, it says "the sum of the distances between points A and M is \(\frac{\sqrt{2}R}{2}
