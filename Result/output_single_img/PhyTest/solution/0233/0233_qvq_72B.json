[ E = -\frac{d\Phi_B}{dt} \]

where \(\Phi_B\) is the magnetic flux through the loop.

The magnetic flux through the area in the magnetic field is:

\[ \Phi_B = B \times A \]

where B is the magnetic field strength and A is the area in the field.

Given that B = (3 + 2t) T and A = 0.02 mÂ², the magnetic flux is:

\[ \Phi_B = (3 + 2t) \times 0.02 \]

\[ \Phi_B = 0.06 + 0.04t \]

Now, differentiating both sides with respect to time t to find the induced EMF:

\[ E = \frac{d\Phi_B}{dt} = 0.04 \] volts

Wait, but according to the key step, it says E = 0.04 V, which matches what I just calculated.

Next, the induced current I in the wire frame can be found using Ohm's law:

\[ I = \frac{E}{R}
