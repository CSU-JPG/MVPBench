{P_A V_A}{T_A} = \frac{P_C V_C}{T_C}\), and from that, T_C = 600 K.

Let me verify that.

Given:

P_A = 4 atm

V_A = 10 L

T_A = 300 K

P_C = 2 atm

V_C = 40 L

We need to find T_C.

Using the ideal gas law:

\(\frac{P_A V_A}{T_A} = \frac{P_C V_C}{T_C}\)

Plugging in the values:

\(\frac{4 * 10}{300} = \frac{2 * 40}{T_C}\)

Simplify:

\(\frac{40}{300} = \frac{80}{T_C}\)

Which simplifies to:

\(\frac{1}{7.5}
