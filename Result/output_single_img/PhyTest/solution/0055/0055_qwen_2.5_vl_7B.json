  ["The total distance traveled by the particle is the sum of the lengths of the two semi-circular arcs.", "The length of one semi-circular arc is $\pi R$ where $R = 1\mathrm{m}$. Therefore, the total distance is $2\pi R = 2\pi \times 1 = 2\pi \mathrm{m}$.", "The average speed is the total distance divided by the total time taken.", "The average speed is $\frac{2\pi}{5} \approx 1.256\mathrm{m/s}$.", "The average velocity is the displacement divided by the total time taken.", "The displacement is the straight-line distance between points A and C, which is the diameter of the circle, i.e., $2R = 2\mathrm{m}$.", "The average velocity is $\frac{2}{5} = 0.4\mathrm{m/s}$."]
