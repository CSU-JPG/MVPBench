  ["At the highest point of ball A, it exerts no force on the rod.", "The tension in the rod at this point is zero because ball A is not exerting any force on the rod.", "The force exerted by ball B on the rod is equal to the weight of ball B plus the tension in the rod at the highest point of ball A.", "Since the tension in the rod is zero, the force exerted by ball B on the rod is simply the weight of ball B, which is $mg$. However, since the rod is symmetric and the system is in equilibrium, the force exerted by ball B on the rod is three times the weight of one ball, which is $3mg$."]
