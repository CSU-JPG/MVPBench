Explanation of Key Reasoning Steps:

1. **Identify the forces acting on ball A at the highest point.**  
   - At the highest point, ball A exerts no force on the rod, meaning the centripetal force is provided entirely by gravity.

2. **Calculate the centripetal force required for ball A.**  
   - The centripetal force is given by \( F_c = \frac{mv^2}{r} \), where \( r = L \).

3. **Determine the velocity of ball A.**  
   - Since the centripetal force is provided by gravity, \( mg = \frac{mv^2}{L} \).

4. **Relate the velocity of ball A to ball B.**  
   - Both balls have the same angular velocity, so \( v_A = v_B \).

5. **Calculate the force exerted by ball B on the rod.**  
   - For ball B, the centripetal force is \( F_c = \frac{mv^2}{2L} \), and the net force is \( F_{net}
