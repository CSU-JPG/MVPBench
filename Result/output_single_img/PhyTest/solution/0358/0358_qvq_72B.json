{2} L \) from point O. Point O is the midpoint of the horizontal line connecting A and B. M and N are on the perpendicular bisector of the line connecting A and B. So, essentially, A and B are on a horizontal line, and M and N are vertically above and below O, respectively.

The x-axis is established with O as the origin, and it's directed vertically downwards as the positive direction. The electric potential at infinity is zero, and there's a graph showing how the electric potential \( \phi \) varies with position \( x \) along ON.

Additionally, there's a small ball \( S_1 \) with charge \( Q \) that falls vertically from point M with a certain initial kinetic energy and passes through point N after some time. Its acceleration \( a \) varies with position \( x \) along ON, as shown in another graph.

My goal is to find the magnitude of the electric force experienced by \( S_1 \) at point M.

Looking at the key reasoning steps provided:

1. \( F_A = \frac{k Q^2}{R_M^2} \), where \( R_M \) is the distance from point A to point M.

2. \( F_M = 2 F_A \sin 45^\circ \)

3. Combining these, \( F_M = \frac{\sqrt{2} k Q^2}{4 L^2} \)

I need to verify and understand how these steps lead to the final answer.

First, let's confirm the distance \( R_M \). Since A and M are both at a distance \( \sqrt{2}
