{2} \, R \), and there are some key steps provided, but I need to figure out the logical order for these steps.

First, I need to understand the setup. We have a hemispherical glass brick with base AB and center O. Light is coming in perpendicular to AB, so straight down onto the base. Then, it's interacting with the curved surface of the hemisphere, and there's some talk about total internal reflection.

Looking at the key steps:

1. There's a mention of incident and refraction angles, with \(\theta = 45^\circ\), \(\alpha = 30^\circ\), and then calculating the refractive index \( n = \sqrt{2} \).

2. There's a step about the critical angle for total internal reflection, \( C = 45^\circ \), using \( \sin{C} = \frac{1}{n} \).

3. Finally, calculating the maximum width \( L = 2d = 2R \sin{45^\circ} = \sqrt{2}
