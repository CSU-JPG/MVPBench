[ mg = k x \]

where \(x\) is the compression in the spring from its equilibrium position. Solving for \(x\), we get:

\[ x = \frac{mg}{k} \]

Now, when a constant force F is applied upward on block A, the spring is further compressed or extended depending on the direction of F relative to the initial position. However, the problem states that F is applied vertically upward, so it's pulling A upward.

We need to find the initial acceleration of A, which means right at the moment when F is applied, before any significant movement has occurred.

At this initial moment, the spring hasn't had time to adjust its length significantly, so the spring force is still approximately the same as it was at rest, which is \( mg \).

Wait, but that might not be entirely accurate. Actually, since the spring was initially compressed by \( x = \frac{mg}{k} \), and now F is applied upward, the net force on A would be:

\[ F_{net} = F - mg - kx \]

But since \( mg = kx \), this simplifies to:

\[ F_{net} = F - mg - mg = F - 2mg \]

Now, applying Newton's second law:

\[ ma = F_{net} \]

\[ m a = F - 2mg \]

\[ a = \frac{F - 2mg}{m} \]
