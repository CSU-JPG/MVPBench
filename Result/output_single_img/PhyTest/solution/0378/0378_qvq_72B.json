{1}{2} mv_0^2 \)

Conservation of energy gives:

\[ mgh = \frac{1}{2} mv_0^2 \]

From this, we can solve for \( v_0 \):

\[ v_0 = \sqrt{2gh} \]

**Step 2: Collision of A and B**

This is a perfectly inelastic collision since A and B stick together.

Momentum is conserved in this collision.

Initial momentum: \( p_i = m \cdot v_0 + 0 \) (since B is stationary)

Final momentum: \( p_f = (m + 2m) \cdot v_1 \)

Conservation of momentum:

\[ m v_0 = 3m v_1 \]
