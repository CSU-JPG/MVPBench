{\sqrt{3}R}{2}\)

- MC = \(\frac{\sqrt{3}R}{3}\)

- We need to find the refractive index \(n\) of the glass.

From the key steps provided:

1. Incident angle at AB interface: \(i = 60^\circ\), with \(\sin i = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\)

2. Incident angle at BC interface: \(i' = 30^\circ\)

3. Using the law of refraction: \(n = \frac{\sin i}{\sin r}\), where \(r = 30^\circ\), leading to \(n = \sqrt{3}\)

My goal is to understand how these steps are connected and ensure that each step logically follows from the previous ones.

Let's start by understanding the geometry.

Consider the quarter-circle with center at point O, assuming O is the center of the circle from which the quarter-circle is taken.

Point P is on the arc, and the distance from P to AC is given as \(\frac{\sqrt{3}R}{2}\). Since AC is one side of the square, and the radius is \(R\), we can relate this distance to the angle at which the light enters.

Similarly, point M is on BC, and MC = \(\frac{\sqrt{3}R}{3}\). So, BM would be \(R - \frac{\sqrt{3}R}{3}\).

Wait, perhaps I need a better approach.

Let me try to sketch this.
