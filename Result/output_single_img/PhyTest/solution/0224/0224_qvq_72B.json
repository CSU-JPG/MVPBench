\]

where \(\Phi_B\) is the magnetic flux.

Given that the magnetic field is changing at a rate \(k\), and only half of the square is in the magnetic field, I need to find the effective area experiencing the change in magnetic field.

The area exposed to the magnetic field is half of the square's area, which is:

\[
A = \frac{1}{2} L^2
\]

Since the magnetic field is perpendicular to the area, the magnetic flux is:

\[
\Phi_B = B \cdot A = B \cdot \frac{1}{2} L^2
\]

Given that \(B\) is changing at a rate \(k\), which I assume is \(\frac{dB}{dt} = k\), then the rate of change of flux is:

\[
\frac{d\Phi_B}{dt} = \frac{d}{dt}\left(B \cdot \frac{1}{2} L^2\right) = \frac{dB}{dt} \cdot \frac{1}{2} L^2 = k \cdot \frac{1}{2} L^2
\]
