["First, in a v-t graph, the area enclosed by the curve and the coordinate axes represents the displacement.", "From the graph, it can be seen that the displacements of the two cars from 10 s to 30 s are equal.", "Next, Since the two cars are side by side at t=30 s, it follows that the two cars are also side by side at t=10 s."]
