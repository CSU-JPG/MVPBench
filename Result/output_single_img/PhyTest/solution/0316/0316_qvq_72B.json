{-3} \) m³

- In state A: \( P_A = 3 \times 10^5 \) Pa and \( V_A = 2 \times 10^{-3} \) m³

Additionally, we know that the temperature in state A is 27 °C. I need to find the temperature in state B.

Okay, so we have pressures and volumes for both states A and B, and we know the temperature for state A. Since it's an ideal gas, we can use the ideal gas law to relate these quantities.

The ideal gas equation is:

\[
PV = nRT
\]

Where:

- P is pressure

- V is volume

- n is the number of moles

- R is the ideal gas constant

- T is temperature

Since the amount of gas (n) doesn't change, we can use the combined gas law, which relates the initial and final states:

\[
\frac{P_A V_A}{T_A} = \frac{P_B V_B}{T_B}
\]

This is what key_step_3 is referring to.

So, if I plug in the known values, I can solve for \( T_B \).

First, convert the temperature from degrees Celsius to Kelvin:

\[
T_A = 27 °C + 273.15 = 300 K
\]

Now, plug in the values into the combined gas law equation:

\[
\frac{(3 \times 10^5) \times (2 \times 10^{-3})}{300} = \frac{(2 \times 10^5) \times (2 \times 10^{-3})}{T_B}
\]
