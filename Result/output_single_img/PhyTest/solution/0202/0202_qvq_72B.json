{U}{R}\).

2. **Key Step 2**: This focuses on the semi-circular part \(MQN\). It uses the resistance law to relate the resistance of the semi-circular part \(R'\) to that of the straight part \(R\). Specifically, it states that \(\frac{R}{2r} = \frac{R'}{\pi r}\), leading to \(R' = \frac{\pi R}{2}\). Then, it calculates the current \(I'\) in the semi-circular part as \(I' = \frac{U}{R'} = \frac{2}{\pi} I\). Finally, it calculates the Ampere force \(F'\) on the semi-circular part as \(F' = B I' \cdot 2r = \frac{2}{\pi} F\).

3. **Key Step 3**: This step considers the direction of the Ampere forces on both parts and adds their magnitudes since they are in the same direction. The total Ampere force is \(F + F' = (1 + \frac{2}
