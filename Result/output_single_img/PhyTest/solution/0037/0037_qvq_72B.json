{t_0}{2} \), then decreases linearly back to zero at time \( t_0 \), and continues in a similar pattern, but in the negative direction, reaching \( -a_0 \) at time \( \frac{3t_0}{2} \), and then back to zero at time \( 2t_0 \).

So, the acceleration is changing direction at \( t = t_0 \) and \( t = 2t_0 \), and it's symmetric around those points.

Now, the particle starts from rest, meaning its initial velocity is zero. The velocity of the particle is the integral of its acceleration with respect to time. So, to find the velocity at any time, I need to integrate the acceleration function from time 0 to that time.

Given the piecewise linear nature of the acceleration graph, I can divide the time into intervals and find the velocity in each interval.

Let's define the time intervals based on the key points in the acceleration graph:

1. From \( t = 0 \) to \( t = \frac{t_0}{2} \): acceleration increases from 0 to \( a_0 \).

2. From \( t = \frac{t_0}{2} \) to \( t = t_0 \): acceleration decreases from \( a_0 \) to 0.

3. From \( t = t_0 \) to \( t = \frac{3t_0}{2} \): acceleration decreases from 0 to \( -a_0 \).

4. From \( t = \frac{3t_0}{2} \) to \( t = 2t_0 \): acceleration increases from \( -a_0 \) to 0.

I need to find the velocity in each of these intervals.

First interval: \( 0 \) to \( \frac{t_0}{2}
