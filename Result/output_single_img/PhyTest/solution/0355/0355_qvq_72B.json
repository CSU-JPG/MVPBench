{v_1}{t_1}\). Since it's uniformly accelerated motion, this formula for acceleration is appropriate.

Then, according to Newton's second law, the net force is equal to mass times acceleration. So, \(F_1 = (M + m) a\), where \(M\) is the mass of the aircraft and \(m\) is the total mass of the mover and the coil.

Finally, by substituting the values and solving the equations, they arrive at \(I = \frac{(m + M) v_1}{n l B t_1}
