[
\Phi = B \cdot A \cdot \cos \theta
\]

where:

- \(B\) is the magnetic field strength,

- \(A\) is the area of the loop,

- \(\theta\) is the angle between the magnetic field and the normal to the area.

In the initial position, the coil is parallel to the magnetic field, which means the magnetic field lines are parallel to the plane of the coil. So, the angle between the magnetic field and the normal to the coil is 90 degrees, because the normal to the coil is perpendicular to the plane of the coil.

Wait a minute, in the diagram, point O is the origin, and points A, B, and C are vertices of the coil. The z-axis is pointing towards point A, and the x-axis is pointing towards point C. The y-axis is pointing upwards. The coil is in the yz-plane initially, I think.

But the problem says that the magnetic field is in the positive x-direction. So, if the coil is in the yz-plane, its normal would be in the x-direction, which is along the magnetic field. So, initially, the angle between the magnetic field and the normal is 0 degrees, not 90 degrees. That means the initial magnetic flux is:

\[
\Phi_1 = B \cdot A \cdot \cos 0^\circ = B \cdot A \cdot 1 = B \cdot A
