[ E = B \times L \times v \]

where:

- \( B \) is the magnetic field strength (1.0 T)

- \( L \) is the length of the conductor in the magnetic field (1.0 m)

- \( v \) is the velocity of the conductor (2 m/s)

Plugging in the values:

\[ E = 1.0 \, \text{T} \times 1.0 \, \text{m} \times 2 \, \text{m/s} = 2 \, \text{V} \]

So, the induced EMF is 2 volts.

Next, I need to find the current flowing through the resistor. The circuit consists of the resistor \( R \) and the rod's resistance \( r \) in series. The total resistance in the circuit is:

\[ R_{\text{total}} = R + r = 3.0 \, \Omega + 1.0 \, \Omega = 4.0 \, \Omega \]

Using Ohm's law, the current \( I \) is:

\[ I = \frac{E}{R_{\text{total}}} = \frac{2 \, \text{V}}{4.0 \, \Omega} = 0.5 \, \text{A} \]
