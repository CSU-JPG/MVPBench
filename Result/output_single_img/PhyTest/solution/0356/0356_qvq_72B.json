{\frac{1}{3}} v \), where \( f \) is the air resistance, \( k \) is the proportionality constant, \( m \) is the mass of the oil droplet, and \( v \) is its velocity.

First, let's understand the setup. There are two large metal plates separated by a distance \( d \), with a small hole in the upper plate. Oil droplets are sprayed through this hole and some acquire electric charges. There are two spherical oil droplets, \( A \) and \( B \), each with mass \( m_0 \), falling along the same vertical line.

Initially, no voltage is applied between the plates. Both droplets fall with a uniform velocity, covering a distance \( h_1 \) in time \( t \). Then, a voltage \( U \) is applied, with the upper plate connected to the positive terminal. After this, droplet \( A \) continues to fall at its original velocity, while droplet \( B \) starts moving upwards with a uniform velocity after some time, rises through a distance \( h_2 \) (where \( h_2 \neq h_1 \)) in the same time \( t \), and then merges with droplet \( A \) to form a new oil droplet that continues moving between the plates until it reaches a uniform velocity.

My goal is to find \( k \), given the relationships between mass, velocity, distance, time, and gravity.

Looking at the key reasoning steps provided:

1. When no voltage is applied, the magnitude of the oil droplet's velocity during uniform motion is \( v_1 = \frac{h_1}{t} \).

2. During uniform motion, the weight of the oil droplet equals the air resistance: \( m_0 g = f \).

3. The air resistance is also given by \( f = k m_0^{\frac{1}{3}} v_1 \).

4. Combining these, we can solve for \( k \): \( k = \frac{m_0^{\frac{2}{3}} g t}{h_1}
