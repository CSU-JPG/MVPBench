{2B^{2}L^{2}v_{0}}{R} \).

First, I need to understand the setup. There's a horizontal smooth rectangular metal guide rail, AB and CD, with a conductor rod MN placed on it. The magnetic field is uniform and perpendicular to the rod, pointing downward. Both ends of the rail are connected to resistors with resistance R. There's a spring attached to the rod, and it's oscillating.

At the initial moment, the spring is at its natural length, and the rod has an initial velocity to the left. I need to find the Ampere force at this instant.

So, when the rod is moving, it cuts the magnetic field lines, generating an electromotive force (EMF). The formula for the EMF is \( E = BLv \), where B is the magnetic field strength, L is the length of the rod, and v is the velocity.

At the initial moment, the velocity is \( v_0 \), so the EMF is \( E = BLv_0 \).

Now, this EMF induces a current in the circuit. The circuit consists of the two resistors, one on each side of the rail. Since they are connected in parallel, the equivalent resistance is \( R_{\text{eq}} = \frac{R}{2} \).

The current flowing through the rod is \( I = \frac{E}{R_{\text{eq}}} = \frac{BLv_0}{\frac{R}{2}} = \frac{2BLv_0}{R} \).

The Ampere force on the rod is then \( F = BIL = B \times \frac{2BLv_0}{R} \times L = \frac{2B^2 L^2 v_0}{R}
