{m/s}^2 \).

- It does this until it reaches an altitude of 5000 meters.

- During this phase, the rocket engine expels gas vertically downward, providing the thrust.

### Second Phase:

- At 5000 meters, the direction of gas expulsion changes to an angle \( \theta \) downward and to the right, where \( \cos\theta = \frac{1}{11} \).

- The thrust remains constant, but its direction changes, affecting the missile's acceleration components.

- I need to find the horizontal and vertical accelerations (\( a_x \) and \( a_y \)) after this change.

### Given Data:

- Missile mass: \( m = 100 \, \text{kg} \)

- Initial acceleration: \( a = 10g = 100 \, \text{m/s}^2 \) upward

- Altitude at which direction changes: 5000 meters

- Gas expulsion direction changes to \( \theta \), with \( \cos\theta = \frac{1}{11} \)

- Gravity: \( g = 10 \, \text{m/s}
