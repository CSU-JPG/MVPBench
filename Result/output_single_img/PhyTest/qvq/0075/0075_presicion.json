The elevator is initially stationary, and at that point, the distance from the piston to the bottom of the cylinder is 19 cm. The masses of the cylinder and the piston are given as 4.5 kg and 3 kg, respectively. The area of the piston is 30 cm², and the atmospheric pressure is 1.0 × 10^5 Pa. The maximum tension the rope can withstand is 120 N, and gravity is 10 m/s².",
