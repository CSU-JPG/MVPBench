    "conclusion": "First, let's understand the scenario. We have a spherical ice droplet falling through the atmosphere. There's a temperature inversion, which means that the temperature increases with height in a certain layer. The droplet starts as ice, melts partially in the warmer layer between heights \\( h_A \\) and \\( h_B \\), and then partially freezes again before reaching the ground.",
