There's also a right triangle ABC with angle A being 30 degrees, and side AB is horizontal. A screen MN is placed perpendicular to the horizontal plane at point A. A beam of red light is directed at the center O of the semicircular brick. The refractive index of the brick for red light is √3, and the speed of red light in vacuum is c. The angle between the incident direction and BC is 60 degrees. I need to find the distance between the position where the red light hits the screen and point A.",
