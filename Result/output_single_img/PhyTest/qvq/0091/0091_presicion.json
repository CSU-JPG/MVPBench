    "conclusion": "We have two objects, A and B, each with a mass of 1 kg. They're connected by a massless string that passes over a fixed pulley at the top of an inclined plane. The inclined plane has an angle of 37 degrees with the horizontal, and it's fixed on a horizontal ground. Initially, object B is at the bottom of the inclined plane, and object A is 1 meter above the ground. The plane is long enough, and there's no friction between B and the plane, nor between the string and the pulley. The system is released from rest, and we're supposed to find the time it takes for object B to return to the bottom of the inclined plane after the string breaks when A hits the ground.",
