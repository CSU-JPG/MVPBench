The shadows will move in the opposite direction of the light source movement. For example, if the light source moves to the left, the shadows A, B, C, and D will move to the right. Additionally, the shadows will become smaller as the light source moves further away from the objects. Therefore, the position and size of the shadows will change when the light source moves.",
