    "premise": "The light source moves downward, which affects the angle and intensity of light reaching the objects.",

    "premise": "The shadows A, B, C, and D will both move downward and increase in size due to the light source's downward movement.",
    "conclusion": "The shadows A, B, C, and D will both move downward and increase in size. This is because the light source, which is currently above the objects, will move downward. As a result, the angle of the light rays will change, causing the shadows to elongate and move downward. Additionally, the shadows will become larger because the light source is now closer to the objects, resulting in a greater angle of the light rays and thus larger shadows.",
