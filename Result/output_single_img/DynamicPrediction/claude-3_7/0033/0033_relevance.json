    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "Without knowing the exact power of object A, the most likely outcome is that it will collide first with the scattered red blocks, displacing them with relatively little resistance.",

  },
  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "If object A has sufficient power, it may push through to reach the yellow blocks, but more likely it will stop somewhere among the orange blocks due to the cumulative loss of momentum through multiple collisions.",
    "relevant": "Yes"

    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "The blue and green blocks will probably remain largely undisturbed unless object A is deflected in their direction or has unusually high power.",
