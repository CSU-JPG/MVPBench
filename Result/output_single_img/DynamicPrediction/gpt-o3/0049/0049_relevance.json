  {
    "step_type": "background information",
    "conclusion": "Car A's speed is high enough to push a light wooden cube a short distance, but it will slow appreciably after each hit due to being a small spring-powered toy car.",

  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "Plotting the launch line shows the yellow cube is the first obstacle in the car's direct path, with no other block between the car and the yellow cube.",

  },
  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "The car impacts the yellow cube almost head-on, sliding the cube 5â€“10 cm leftwards, losing part of its speed, and being turned a few degrees downward-left due to off-centre contact.",
    "relevant": "Yes"
  },
  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "After deflection, the car's new path points straight at the marble below the yellow cube, where the marble's density and round shape cause the car to ride up slightly, lose more speed, and deflect further downward-left.",
    "relevant": "Yes"

  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "The car, now moving slowly and toward the lower-left quadrant, reaches the blue cube next, gently hitting it and shifting it a centimetre or two.",

  },
  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "After the blue-cube contact, the car's remaining kinetic energy is gone, and it settles beside the blue cube near the lower-left edge of the cloth.",
    "relevant": "Yes"
  },
  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "The car does not reach the red, green, or purple cubes because earlier collisions bleed off energy and change its heading before it could line up with those blocks.",

  },
  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "Final answer: A will collide, in order, with (1) the yellow cube, (2) the marble, and (3) the blue cube. It will come to rest next to the blue cube in the lower-left part of the table.",
