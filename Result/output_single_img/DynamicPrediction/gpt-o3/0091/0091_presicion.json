    "conclusion": "What 'moving the light forward' means: The instruction says the light is moved forward above the objects. In this view 'forward' is toward the bottom (south) of the frame – i.e., toward the present positions of the shadows.",

    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "premise": "The light source is moved southward while keeping its height the same.",
