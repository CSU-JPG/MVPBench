    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "Final answer: After the lamp is shifted to the right, all four shadows swing to the opposite (left-hand) side of their objects. The two left-hand objects (tart A and towel C) are now farther from the lamp, so their shadows lengthen and spread; the two right-hand objects (spool B and football D) lie almost under the lamp, so their shadows shorten and draw in close to their bases, B’s being small and oval, D’s being a small, nearly circular spot.",
