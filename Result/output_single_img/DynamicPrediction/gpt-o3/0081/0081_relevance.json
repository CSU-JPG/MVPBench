    "conclusion": "A (egg) is a small oval shadow, B (baseball) is the largest round shadow, C (apple) is a medium round/heart-shaped shadow, and D (microphone) is a long, slender, mike-shaped shadow.",
    "relevant": "Yes"
  },
  {
    "step_type": "image description",
    "conclusion": "Heights of the objects above the paving appear roughly the same, so the distance of every shadow from its object is almost identical.",

  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "Keeping lamp-height fixed but increasing |L| flips the shadow to the opposite side, pushes it farther from the object, and stretches it in the left–right direction, causing the area to grow.",

  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "A (egg) shadow will move from the egg’s right side to its left side, remain the smallest, become a little wider, and sit roughly the same distance from the egg as the other shadows.",
    "relevant": "Yes"

    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "C (apple) shadow will jump to the apple’s left side, keep its slightly flattened apple outline, enlarge horizontally, and remain at a similar distance from the apple as A and B.",

    "relevant": "Yes"

  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "After the move, the relative order of shadows (viewed from above) will be: tip of D, centre of D, centres of A, C, B (clustered), objects themselves, and then the lamp.",

  },
  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "Every shadow’s left–right dimension increases, vertical widths alter slightly, and each patch looks slightly squashed sideways. Relative areas keep the ranking: B > C > D > A.",

  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
