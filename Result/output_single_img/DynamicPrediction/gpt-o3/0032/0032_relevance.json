    "conclusion": "The image shows a green surface with blocks arranged in clusters: red blocks in a semicircle, a yellow-orange tower, and a compact blue-green cluster. Block A is positioned on the right side, ready to move.",
    "relevant": "Yes"
  },
  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "Block A approaches with moderate speed, and kinetic energy is efficiently transferred on impact due to equal mass of blocks and low surface friction.",

    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "Block A hits the front-most red block, pushing it directly forward and slightly decreasing A's speed.",

  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",

    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "Each subsequent red block moves outward along the arc, spreading slightly but staying near their original semicircular path.",
    "relevant": "Yes"
  },
  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "The last red block nudges the base orange cube of the yellow stack, causing the orange cube to slide and the two yellow cubes above to topple sideways, collapsing the tower toward the gap between red and blue blocks.",
    "relevant": "Yes"

  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "No block from Aâ€™s original line has enough remaining momentum to reach the compact blue-green cluster, so that cluster stays essentially untouched.",

  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "Final answer: After A strikes, it stops inside the red arc; the red blocks shift a little but stay in a widened semicircle; the yellow-orange tower collapses into the center; blue and green blocks are unaffected.",
