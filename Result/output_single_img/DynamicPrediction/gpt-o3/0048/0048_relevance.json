    "step_type": "logical inference",

  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "With most of its kinetic energy spent after three collisions, car A rolls a short extra distance past the blue block and comes to rest inside the boundary of the block cluster near the gap between the blue and purple blocks.",
    "relevant": "Yes"
