    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "A will first tap the small orange cube, pushing it ahead a little, then run straight into the green rectangular prism just beyond it. The car cannot shift that larger block and finally comes to rest with its nose against the near left edge of the green prism, a few centimetres above its initial diagonal path.",
