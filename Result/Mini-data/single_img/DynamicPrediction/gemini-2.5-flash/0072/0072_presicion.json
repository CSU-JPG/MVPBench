    "conclusion": "When objects A and B are placed down at the location of objects C, D, E, and F, gravity pulls A downwards until it makes contact with the surface or objects C and D. A will then come to rest, supported by the surface and/or C and D, exerting its weight upon them while they provide an upward supporting force. Similarly, gravity pulls B downwards until it makes contact with the surface or objects E and F (likely the stack of E and F). B will then come to rest, supported by the surface and/or E and F, exerting its weight upon them while they provide an upward supporting force. In essence, A will land on or near C and D, and B will land on or near E and F, resulting in physical contact and the objects resting upon the supporting surfaces or objects.",
