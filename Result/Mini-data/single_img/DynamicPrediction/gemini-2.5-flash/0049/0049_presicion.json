The blue block will likely be pushed away from the point of impact, and Car A will lose some speed and be deflected. The direction of deflection depends on the angle of impact. Based on the initial trajectory and the position of the blue block, a collision on the right side of the blue block is likely.",

Given that the last collision was with the marble, which is located near the center of the table, and assuming the car continues to move generally to the left after the collision, it will eventually stop due to friction.",
