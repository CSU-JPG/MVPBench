    "conclusion": "Let’s analyze the scenario where object 'A' (a black object, possibly a toy car or block) drives into a group of wooden blocks on a green surface. We need to determine the interaction between 'A' and the wooden blocks, considering power, collision, and deflection effects, and predict the final positions of the blocks.",

    "conclusion": "The image shows several wooden blocks scattered on a green surface: Yellow blocks: One in the top left, a stack of two near the center-right, and one in the cluster near the top-right. Blue blocks: Several in a cluster near the top-right. Green blocks: A few in the same top-right cluster with the blue blocks. Orange blocks: Two near the center-left, one under the yellow stack in the center-right. Red blocks: Three in the bottom-left. Object A: A black object (likely a toy car or block) is approaching from the right side, marked with an arrow indicating its direction toward the blocks.",

  {

    "premise": "",
    "conclusion": "The blocks appear to be lightweight wooden cubes, likely uniform in size and weight. Object A is moving directly toward the cluster of blocks, with the yellow stack (two yellow blocks on an orange block) being the closest target in its path.",

  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "premise": "Object A is moving directly toward the cluster of blocks, with the yellow stack being the closest target in its path.",
    "conclusion": "Since this is a toy-like scenario, we can assume A has a moderate speed, enough to cause a collision but not an extremely forceful impact.",

  },
  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "premise": "Object A appears to be a solid black object, possibly a toy car or a heavier block.",
    "conclusion": "For simplicity, let’s assume A is slightly heavier than the wooden blocks. Its power depends on its mass and velocity. Given the context, A likely has enough momentum to displace the blocks upon impact but not enough to send them flying far.",
    "judgment": "Reasonable"
  },
  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "premise": "Object A’s path directly leads to the yellow stack in the center-right.",

  },
  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "premise": "A will first collide with the orange block at the base of the yellow stack.",
    "conclusion": "Since A is moving horizontally, it will strike the orange block head-on. The orange block is supporting two yellow blocks, so the stack’s stability will be disrupted.",

  },
  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "premise": "A will first collide with the orange block at the base of the yellow stack.",
    "conclusion": "A’s momentum will transfer to the orange block, causing it to move. Because the yellow blocks are stacked on top, they will likely topple or be knocked off due to the sudden movement of the base.",
    "judgment": "Match"
  },
  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "premise": "Upon impact, the orange block will be pushed to the left (in the direction of A’s motion).",

  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "premise": "The two yellow blocks on top will lose their balance.",
    "conclusion": "The top yellow block may fall forward (left) or backward (right) depending on the angle of impact and friction. Given A’s direct hit, it’s more likely they’ll both be knocked to the left or slightly scattered.",
    "judgment": "Reasonable"
  },
  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "premise": "The yellow blocks may also collide with nearby blocks as they fall.",
    "conclusion": "If the yellow blocks or orange block are knocked toward the top-right cluster, a secondary collision could occur.",
