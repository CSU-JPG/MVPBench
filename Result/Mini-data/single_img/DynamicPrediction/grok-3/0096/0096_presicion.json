    "conclusion": "The light source is moving to the 'back right.' Assuming the perspective is from above the image: 'Back' means further away from the viewer (toward the top or rear of the image). 'Right' means toward the right side of the image. This suggests the light source will be repositioned diagonally behind the objects, likely in the upper-right quadrant relative to the current setup.",

    "premise": "The size of the shadows may also change depending on the distance between the objects, the light source, and the ground, as well as the angle of incidence.",
    "conclusion": "Shadow A will shift toward the front left (lower left). Since the nail is tall and thin, the shadow will elongate in the direction away from the light source, potentially becoming longer if the light is farther away or shorter if the angle becomes more oblique.",

    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "premise": "The height of each object affects shadow length. Taller objects (like the nail) will cast longer shadows with a more significant shift.",
