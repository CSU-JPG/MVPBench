Given: When the switch is open, the ammeter reading is I0 = 0.5 A. When the switch is closed, the motor starts to rotate, and the voltage U across the circuit remains unchanged.

    "conclusion": "The ammeter A is in series with the entire circuit, measuring the total current. R1 is in series with the motor. The motor M has an internal resistance R2, and when it rotates, it generates a back EMF (electromotive force) because it acts as a generator while consuming power.",

    "premise": "When the switch is open, the motor does not rotate (no current flows through the motor branch). The circuit simplifies to just the ammeter and possibly a path that allows the current I0 = 0.5 A to flow.",
    "conclusion": "The motor is not rotating, so there is no back EMF. The circuit consists of R1 and R2 in series (since the motor’s internal resistance R2 is still part of the circuit). Total resistance when the switch is open: R_total, open = R1 + R2 = 20 Ω + 10 Ω = 30 Ω.",
