We need to find the distance between the point where the light hits the screen and point A. Let’s break it down step by step.",

    "conclusion": "The figure shows a semicircle on the left with diameter BC and center O, where the radius of the semicircle is R. Attached to the right of the semicircle is a right triangle ABC, with the right angle at B (angle ABC = 90°), and angle A = 30°. Side AB is horizontal, and BC is vertical since it’s the diameter of the semicircle. A screen MN is placed at point A, perpendicular to the horizontal plane (so MN is vertical). A red light beam is directed at point O, the center of the semicircle, making a 60° angle with BC. The refractive index of the brick for red light is √3, and the speed of light in a vacuum is C.",

    "premise": "Semicircle: BC is the diameter, so BC = 2R. Since O is the center, OB = OC = R, and OB is perpendicular to BC (since BC is the diameter). Triangle ABC: Right-angled at B, with angle A = 30°. Since angle B = 90°, angle C = 60° (because the angles in a triangle sum to 180°).",
    "conclusion": "Coordinates: Place the figure in the coordinate plane for clarity: Point B at the origin: B = (0, 0). Point C on the y-axis, since BC is vertical: C = (0, 2R), because BC = 2R. Point O, the center of the semicircle, is the midpoint of BC: O = (0, R). Point A lies on the x-axis since AB is horizontal. In triangle ABC, angle C = 60°, angle A = 30°, and BC = 2R. Using trigonometry: AB = BC cos(30°) = 2R · √3/2 = R√3. So, A = (R√3, 0). Screen MN: Positioned at point A, perpendicular to the horizontal plane, so it’s a vertical line at x = R√3.",
