    "conclusion": "The diagram shows a boundary between air (above) and water (below). Here’s what we know: Point A is in the air, and point B is in water. A beam of blue light travels from point A in the air to point O1 on the boundary (O1 is not drawn but described as the point where the light ray hits the boundary). The light refracts at O1 and travels through water to point B. Point O is the intersection of line AB (extended) with the boundary. We need to determine if O1 is to the right of O.",

Air is the region where y > 0, and water is where y < 0. Point O is the intersection of line AB with the boundary, so let’s place O at the origin for simplicity: O = (0, 0). Point A is in the air (above the boundary), so its coordinates are A = (x_A, y_A), where y_A > 0. Point B is in the water (below the boundary), so its coordinates are B = (x_B, y_B), where y_B < 0.",

Since n_2 > n_1, the light bends toward the normal, meaning θ_r < θ_i.",
