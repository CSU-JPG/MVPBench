    "conclusion": "Place the dotted line MN along the y-axis (x = 0), with the magnetic field in the region x > 0. The loop is moving to the right, so its velocity is v i. Since CD is perpendicular to MN, let’s align CD parallel to the y-axis. At the initial moment when D reaches MN, position D at (0, 0). Side CD has length a, so point C is at (0, a). Since CDE is an equilateral triangle, the coordinates of E can be found: The base CD lies along the y-axis from (0, 0) to (0, a). The height of an equilateral triangle with side a is h = sqrt(3)/2 a. The x-coordinate of E (the apex) is at x = -sqrt(3)/2 a, and its y-coordinate is the midpoint of CD, so y = a/2. Thus, E is at (-sqrt(3)/2 a, a/2).",

C crosses x = 0 at t = 0, but we interpret “until C enters” as the moment C is fully in the field, considering the motion. The key interval is from when D enters (t = 0) until E (the leftmost point) crosses x = 0, because the flux changes only while part of the loop is entering the field. E’s x-coordinate is vt - sqrt(3)/2 a. E crosses x = 0 when: vt - sqrt(3)/2 a = 0 implies vt = sqrt(3)/2 a implies t = sqrt(3) a/2 v. So, we consider t from 0 to sqrt(3) a/2 v, the time when the entire loop is in the magnetic field, and flux stops changing.",
