It also shows a toy car, labeled 'A', positioned at the lower right. A red line indicates the intended direction of movement for car A, pointing generally towards the group of red blocks.",

    "conclusion": "The second image shows a later state where the car has moved. We can see that the car has reached the group of red blocks and is in contact with them. The red blocks appear to have been slightly disturbed or pushed by the car. The car's front bumper is against one of the red blocks.",

  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "premise": "The car's 'power' (its initial momentum) is transferred to the red blocks upon collision.",
    "conclusion": "This transfer of energy causes the red blocks to move slightly from their original positions. The collision also significantly reduces the car's speed and momentum.",

    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "premise": "The car has collided with the red blocks primarily head-on or at a slight angle.",
    "conclusion": "The impact appears to have been mostly absorbed by the red blocks and the car itself. There is no significant angle of rebound or deflection that would send the car on a new trajectory towards another group of blocks (like the green or orange ones). The car seems to have come to a stop against the red blocks.",
    "judgment": "Match"
  },
  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "premise": "The car's energy was primarily spent in the collision with the red blocks and causing their slight displacement, and observing the car's position in Image 2 in contact with the red blocks without significant deflection.",
    "conclusion": "The car is likely to stop (or has just stopped) at the point of impact with the red blocks.",
