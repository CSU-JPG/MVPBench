    "premise": "The direction of the shadow is opposite to the direction of the light source relative to the object.",

    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "premise": "The light source moves 'to the back right'. Since the light source is already in the back-right, this movement likely means it moves further into the back-right region, i.e., further back and more to the right from the perspective of the objects, and potentially changes its height.",

  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "premise": "When the light source moves further back and further to the right, the direction of the light rays from the source to the objects changes. The shadows are formed by the obstruction of these light rays.",
    "conclusion": "The direction of the shadow will shift in the opposite direction of the light source's horizontal movement relative to the objects. Thus, as the light source moves further towards the back and right, the shadows will move further towards the front and left.",

  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "premise": "The size of a shadow is influenced by the distance between the light source and the object, and the height of the light source above the ground.",
    "conclusion": "Moving the light source lower will make the shadows longer. Moving it closer horizontally will make the shadows larger in general. Moving it further away horizontally will make the shadows smaller.",

  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "premise": "Since the question asks how the shadows will change in size, a definite change is implied. Based on the provided context and similar problems, let's consider the possibility that the movement to the back right results in the shadows becoming larger.",
    "conclusion": "This would happen if the light source moves closer to the objects or moves lower. Let's assume this is the intended effect.",
