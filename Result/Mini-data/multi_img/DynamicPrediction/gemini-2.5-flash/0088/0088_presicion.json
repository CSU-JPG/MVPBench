If the light source is a point source, the shadow is a perspective projection of the object. Moving the light source horizontally while keeping its height constant (or changing its height) will change the angle of the light rays. This change in angle will affect the size (length and width) and shape of the shadow, especially for objects that are not flat or are oriented at an angle to the light source and the surface.",

The size and shape of the shadows will also change due to the altered angle of the light rays. Specifically, shadow A (chicken leg) appears to become longer and potentially narrower, shadow B (birdcage) shifts left with relatively less change in size or shape, and shadow C (crumpled object) shifts left and significantly changes its shape and size, becoming less extended to the right and more concentrated or elongated downwards.",
