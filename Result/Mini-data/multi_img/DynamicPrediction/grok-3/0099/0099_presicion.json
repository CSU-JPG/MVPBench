    "conclusion": "When the light source moves, the position of the shadow shifts in the direction opposite to the light source movement.

Shadow B (egg) will move toward the bottom right. Shadow C (alarm clock) will also move toward the bottom right, potentially merging or aligning with A depending on the light angle.

    "conclusion": "Size Change: As the light moves to the back, the angle becomes lower (more horizontal). This will stretch the shadows, making them longer and potentially wider, depending on the object's height and the distance to the surface. A and C will become elongated and stretched toward the front right. B will become longer and narrower. D will also elongate and stretch toward the front right.",
