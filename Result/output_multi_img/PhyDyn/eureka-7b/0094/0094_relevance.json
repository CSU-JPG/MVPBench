    "conclusion": "There are four objects above the slabs, which are illuminated by a light source, casting shadows labeled A, B, C, and D on the ground.",

  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "Shadow A is cast by the ice cream cone. If the light source moves downward, the angle of incidence will decrease, causing the shadow to become longer and more spread out. The position of the shadow will move further away from the object, and its size will increase.",
    "relevant": "Yes"

    "conclusion": "Shadow B is cast by the typewriter. Similarly, as the light source moves downward, the angle of incidence will decrease, and the shadow will become longer and more spread out. The position of the shadow will move further away from the object, and its size will increase.",

Shadow B will become longer and more spread out, and its position will move further away from the typewriter. Shadow C will become longer and more spread out, and its position will move further away from the sphere. Shadow D will become longer and more spread out, and its position will move further away from the knife.",
