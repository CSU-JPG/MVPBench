    "conclusion": "The scene contains wooden blocks of various colors (yellow, blue, green, orange, and red) scattered on a green surface, with no particular pattern, and a toy car labeled 'A' approaching from one side.",

    "step_type": "background information",
    "conclusion": "The blocks are wooden, implying they have weight and inertia, and the toy car has kinetic energy due to its motion.",

    "step_type": "logical inference",

    "step_type": "logical inference",

    "step_type": "background information",
    "conclusion": "Since the blocks are wooden and likely somewhat elastic, the collisions are assumed to be partially elastic, conserving some energy but not all.",

  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",

  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "The yellow block, now moving, may collide with other blocks, such as blue or green blocks, creating further interactions.",
