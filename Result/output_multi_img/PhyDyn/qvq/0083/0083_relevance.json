    "conclusion": "Shadows are formed when an object blocks light, creating a dark area behind it. The position and size of the shadow depend on the position of the light source and the object.",

  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "Since the light source is moving away from the objects and also changing direction towards the front right, both the distance and the angle between the light source and the objects are changing, which will affect both the position and size of the shadows.",

    "step_type": "logical inference",

  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "If the light source moves farther away, the shadows would become smaller only if the light source is very far away, like the sun, where the rays are almost parallel. For a point light source, moving it farther away would make the shadows softer but not necessarily smaller in size.",

  },
  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "If the light was initially straight above object A, its shadow A would be directly below it. If the light moves to the front right, the shadow should shift towards the opposite direction, which would be towards the back left.",
