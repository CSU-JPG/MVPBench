    "step_type": "image description",
    "conclusion": "In the image, there are two orange blocks stacked on top of each other towards the top right, another orange block closer to the bottom left, some red blocks scattered around, a couple of blue blocks, a few yellow ones, and some green blocks.",
    "relevant": "Yes"

    "relevant": "Yes"
  },
  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "The car might push blocks, causing them to move, or be blocked by blocks depending on its size and momentum.",
    "relevant": "Yes"

    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "Since the car is a toy, it is probably not very heavy and might not have enough force to move larger blocks easily, but smaller blocks might be easier to push.",
    "relevant": "Yes"

    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "The shapes of the blocks might affect interactions, and they appear to be cubes of similar size based on the image.",

  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "The surface might affect how the blocks move when pushed by the car, depending on whether it is flat and smooth or textured.",

    "conclusion": "The green surface is visible in the image and appears flat.",

  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "If the car collides with the marble, it might bounce off in a different direction due to the marble's round and smooth nature.",
