    "step_type": "image description",
    "conclusion": "The blocks are in various colors (blue, orange, red, green, yellow) but they appear to be stacked in a way that creates some obstacles.",

    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "The vehicle may deflect off the blocks, but due to the nature of the blocks (rigid), any significant deflection would not be possible unless the vehicle is moving very slowly or the blocks are set up to be flexible, which is unlikely for toy blocks.",

  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
