  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "The exact stopping position depends on the remaining momentum after all collisions, but it should be close to the center of the red block arrangement.",

  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "Based on the described interactions and the observed behavior in the images, the car will collide with the red blocks, pushing them out of the way. It will eventually stop near the center of the red block arrangement, possibly nestled between a few blocks, due to the loss of momentum after multiple collisions.",
    "relevant": "Yes"
