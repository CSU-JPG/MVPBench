    "step_type": "background information",
    "conclusion": "When the light source moves backward, shadows will lengthen due to the angle between the light source and the objects becoming more acute, and their direction may shift slightly.",

    "conclusion": "Shadow A will extend further away from the birdcage, possibly moving more towards the bottom right, and become longer and thinner.",

    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "Shadow B will move slightly further away from the birdcage, aligning with the overall elongation of shadow A, and elongate but remain relatively close to the birdcage.",
