  {
    "step_type": "background information",
    "conclusion": "Shadows are formed when an object blocks the light from reaching a surface. The shape and size of the shadow depend on the position of the light source relative to the object.",

  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "When the light source is closer to the object, the shadow is larger because the light rays spread out more. Conversely, when the light source is farther away, the shadow becomes smaller.",

  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "If the light source moves backward (away from the objects), it effectively increases the distance between the light source and the objects. This will cause the shadows to become smaller.",

  },
  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "As the light source moves backward, the direction of the light rays becomes more parallel. This means that the shadows will shift slightly but not drastically change their position unless the objects themselves move or the angle of the light changes significantly.",

    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "Since the objects remain stationary and the light source only moves backward, the position of the shadows should remain relatively unchanged.",

    "step_type": "logical inference",
