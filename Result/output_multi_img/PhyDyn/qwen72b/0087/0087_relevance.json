    "step_type": "background information",
    "conclusion": "In the initial setup, shadows A, B, C, and D are cast by their respective objects, appearing elongated and shifted slightly away from the objects due to the light source being positioned above and in front of the objects.",

  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "When the light source moves backward, the angle at which the light rays hit the objects will change, causing the shadows to shift and change in size.",

  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "When the light source moves backward, the shadows will become smaller because the light rays hitting the objects will be more parallel, resulting in less spread-out shadows.",
