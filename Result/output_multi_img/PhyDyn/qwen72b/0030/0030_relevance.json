    "conclusion": "The table contains different colored blocks (yellow, blue, red, purple, green) and a small spherical marble with pink and blue colors. These objects have varying shapes and sizes, suggesting they will interact differently upon collision.",

  {
    "step_type": "background information",
    "conclusion": "The car labeled 'A' enters the scene from the bottom-right corner and moves towards the center of the table, indicating an initial velocity directed towards the blocks.",

  },
  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "Yellow block appears to be pushed slightly but remains mostly stationary upon impact, implying that it has some mass and resistance against movement.",

  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",

    "step_type": "logical inference",

    "step_type": "logical inference",

  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "As the car collides with the red and blue blocks, it is deflected upwards and slightly to the left.",

  },
  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "The car's path is altered multiple times due to interactions with these blocks, reducing its speed gradually.",
    "relevant": "Yes"
  },
  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "Given the car's trajectory and the force dissipation through multiple collisions, it is likely to come to a stop near the center of the table, close to the purple and red blocks.",
    "relevant": "Yes"
  },
  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "The car might end up between the purple and red blocks, as these two blocks combined provide enough resistance to halt its motion completely.",
    "relevant": "Yes"
  },
  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "The car will eventually stop near the center of the table, resting between the purple and red blocks. The sequence of collisions with various blocks and the deflection caused by their mass and placement result in a gradual loss of kinetic energy, bringing the car to a standstill in this central area.",
    "relevant": "Yes"
