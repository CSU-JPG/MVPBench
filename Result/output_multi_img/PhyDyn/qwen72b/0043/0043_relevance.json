    "step_type": "image description",
    "conclusion": "As seen in the second frame (Image 2), the car has entered the group of blocks and has already collided with some blocks, particularly the red blocks. The red blocks appear to be scattered slightly, indicating that they were hit by the car with sufficient force to displace them.",

    "conclusion": "In the third frame (Image 3), the car is now lying on its side, suggesting that it has collided with another block or multiple blocks causing it to flip over. The car is now positioned among the green and blue blocks, indicating that these blocks were involved in the subsequent collisions after the initial impact with the red blocks.",

    "step_type": "logical inference",

    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "After the car flipped, it appears to have lost most of its kinetic energy due to the impact and friction with the surface.",

    "step_type": "logical inference",

  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "Car A collides initially with the red blocks, scattering them, then continues to collide with the green and blue blocks, resulting in the car flipping over and stopping among these blocks. The car eventually comes to rest due to the loss of kinetic energy from the collisions and the obstruction provided by the surrounding blocks.",
