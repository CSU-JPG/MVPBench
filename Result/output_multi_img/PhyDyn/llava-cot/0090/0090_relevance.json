    "conclusion": "The image shows four objects placed on a textured surface: a milk carton labeled A, a yellow rectangular sign labeled B, a baseball labeled C, and a circular object with a pink top labeled D. Each object casts a distinct shadow on the ground.",
    "relevant": "Yes"
  },
  {
    "step_type": "background information",
    "conclusion": "Initially, the objects are illuminated by a light source positioned at a certain distance. This creates shadows A, B, C, and D on the ground. The shadows are dark and elongated, with defined edges.",
    "relevant": "Yes"

    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "When the light source moves forward, the distance between the light source and the objects decreases.",
    "relevant": "Yes"
  },
  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "As the light source moves closer, the angle of the light rays hitting the objects becomes more acute, causing the shadows to elongate and increase in size.",
    "relevant": "Yes"
  },
  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "The increase in shadow size is more pronounced for objects further from the light source, as the change in angle is greater.",
    "relevant": "Yes"
  },
  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "The movement of the light source forward results in a shift in the position of the shadows, which will appear to 'move' further away from the light source's new position.",
    "relevant": "Yes"
  },
  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "The shift in shadow position is caused by the altered angle of the light rays as the light source moves.",

  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "The closer proximity of the light source to the objects can intensify the contrast between the shadows and the surrounding ground.",
    "relevant": "Yes"
  },
  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "The shadows become darker as more light is blocked by the objects, highlighting their shape and position.",
    "relevant": "Yes"
  },
  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "When the light source moves forward above the objects, the shadows A, B, C, and D on the ground will change both in position and size, becoming larger and moving further away from the light source.",
    "relevant": "Yes"
  },
  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "The increased size and change in position of the shadows are due to the altered angle of the light rays hitting the objects as the light source moves closer.",
