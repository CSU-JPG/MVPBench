    "conclusion": "To solve the problem, the solution will analyze the image to identify the shadows cast by the objects and reason through how the shadows will change in position and size when the light source moves forward.",

  {
    "step_type": "image description",
    "conclusion": "The image shows four objects on a wooden surface: a lamp, a chocolate-covered cookie, a cake, and a sundae. Each object casts a distinct shadow on the ground, labeled A, B, C, and D. These shadows are cast by an upward light source.",
    "relevant": "Yes"
  },
  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "The lamp, cookie, cake, and sundae cast shadows A, B, C, and D, respectively, on the ground.",

  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "When the light source moves forward, the angle of light reaching the objects increases.",
    "relevant": "Yes"
  },
  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "As the light source moves forward, the shadows (A, B, C, D) will appear to move further back on the ground because the angle of the light increases, creating longer shadows.",
    "relevant": "Yes"
  },
  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "The increased angle of the light means the shadows will grow in size. This is because the light now casts a more oblique shadow, making the shadows broader and longer.",
    "relevant": "Yes"
  },
  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "When the light source moves forward, shadows A, B, C, and D will both move further back and grow in size.",
    "relevant": "Yes"
  },
  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "Thus, the shadows A, B, C, and D will change both in position and size.",
