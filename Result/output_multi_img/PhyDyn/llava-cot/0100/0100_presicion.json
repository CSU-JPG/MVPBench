    "premise": "",
    "conclusion": "The image shows three objects casting shadows on a flat surface. These shadows are labeled A, B, C, and D. A cat figurine, a corkboard with sticky notes, and a postcard on a toilet-shaped stand are visible.",

    "premise": "The light source is currently in the foreground, casting sharp shadows.",
    "conclusion": "If the light source moves to the back left, the shadows A, B, C, and D will move in the opposite direction (toward the right), becoming longer due to the increased distance from the light source.",

    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "premise": "Conversely, if the light source moves to the back right, the shadows will move in that direction, becoming shorter and less distinct.",
    "conclusion": "This movement and change in size are due to the inverse square law, where shadow size increases with distance from the light source.",

    "premise": "If the light source moves to the back left, the shadows A, B, C, and D will move to the right, and they will become longer and bigger.",
    "conclusion": "This is because the objects are farther away from the light source, making the shadows larger and more elongated.",

    "premise": "On the other hand, if the light source moves to the back right, the shadows will move to the left, and they will become shorter and smaller.",
