    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "premise": "The light source moves backward above the objects.",
    "conclusion": "The increased distance between the light source and the objects results in more diffuse lighting. Shadows appear larger because the light spreads over a larger area. The shadows become more elongated as they extend in the direction of the light source movement.",
