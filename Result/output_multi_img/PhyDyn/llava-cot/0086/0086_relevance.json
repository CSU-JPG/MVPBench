    "step_type": "image description",
    "conclusion": "The image depicts four objects on a wooden surface, each casting a distinct shadow. Object 1 (a slice of pizza) casts shadow A. Object 2 (a camera) casts shadow B. Object 3 (a piece of jewelry) casts shadow C. Object 4 (a rectangular block) casts shadow D. The light source is positioned above these objects, casting the shadows on the ground.",
    "relevant": "Yes"
  },
  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "As the light source moves further back, the angles at which light travels to create shadows change, resulting in the shadows becoming longer and stretched out in the direction opposite to the movement of the light source.",
    "relevant": "Yes"
  },
  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "The increased distance between the light source and the objects results in more diffuse lighting, causing shadows to appear larger as the light spreads over a larger area. The shadows become more elongated as they extend in the direction of the light source movement.",
    "relevant": "Yes"
  },
  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "When the light source moves backward above the objects, shadows A, B, C, and D will change both in position and size. The shadows will become longer and stretched out in the direction opposite to the movement of the light source, and they will become larger as the light source is further away from the objects.",
    "relevant": "Yes"
