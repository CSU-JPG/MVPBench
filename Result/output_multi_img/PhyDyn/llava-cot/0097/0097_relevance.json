    "step_type": "image description",
    "conclusion": "The image shows four objects on a textured surface, each casting a distinct shadow. Object 1 casts shadow A, Object 2 casts shadow B, Object 3 casts shadow C, and Object 4 casts shadow D. The shadows are elongated and clearly defined, suggesting a perpendicular light source.",

    "step_type": "logical inference",

    "conclusion": "Shadow D is the longest and located on the right side of the image.",
    "relevant": "Yes"

  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "When the light source moves to the back right, all the shadows (A, B, C, D) will change in both their position and size, becoming longer and more elongated.",
