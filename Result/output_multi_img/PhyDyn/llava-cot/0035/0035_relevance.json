    "conclusion": "The image shows a car labeled 'A' positioned in the lower left corner, moving towards a group of colorful blocks. There are several block groups: a yellow block, two green blocks, a blue block, three orange blocks, and two red blocks. Each block appears to be a different size and shape.",

  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "Once the car collides with the green block, further deflection is likely, causing the car to stop near that block due to loss of momentum and any obstruction by the green block's surface.",
