    "conclusion": "The image shows four objects on a flat surface: a bottle, a curved object, a small sphere, and a rectangular object with holes. Each object casts a distinct shadow on the ground. The shadows are labeled as A, B, C, and D, with varying shapes and sizes.",

    "premise": "If the light source moves backward, above the objects, the shadows will change due to changes in the angle of light incidence.",
