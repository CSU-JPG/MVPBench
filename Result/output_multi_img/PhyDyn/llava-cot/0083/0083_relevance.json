    "step_type": "background information",
    "conclusion": "To solve the problem, the solution involves analyzing the image, identifying the shadows cast by the objects, and determining how these shadows will change when the light source moves to the front right, considering both position and size changes.",
    "relevant": "Yes"
  },
  {
    "step_type": "image description",
    "conclusion": "The image shows four objects on a tiled floor, each casting a distinct shadow on the ground. The shadows are labeled as A, B, C, and D, and the objects are positioned such that their shadows fall in different directions and areas on the floor.",
    "relevant": "Yes"
  },
  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "The shadows A, B, C, and D on the floor correspond to the four objects above them.",
    "relevant": "Yes"
  },
  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "The current position of the light source is on the left, causing the shadows to be cast to the right.",
    "relevant": "Yes"
  },
  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "When the light source moves to the front right, it will no longer be perpendicular to the objects, and this change in angle will affect the shadows.",
    "relevant": "Yes"
  },
  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "The shadows will elongate and become larger due to the angle change, as objects generally cast longer shadows when light hits them from a more direct angle.",
    "relevant": "Yes"
  },
  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "The shadows will shift in position, moving towards the right as the light source moves rightward.",
    "relevant": "Yes"
  },
  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "When the light source moves to the front right, the shadows A, B, C, and D will both increase in size and shift their positions on the ground.",
    "relevant": "Yes"

  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",

  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "The shadow of object C will stretch and become longer.",
    "relevant": "Yes"
  },
  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "The shadow of object D will shift towards the right and increase in size.",
    "relevant": "Yes"
  },
  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "The exact changes in the shadows will depend on the angle at which the light source moves and its distance from the objects.",
    "relevant": "Yes"
  },
  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "These changes in shadow size and position can be observed only when the light source is in motion.",
    "relevant": "Yes"
