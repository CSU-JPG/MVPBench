    "step_type": "image description",
    "conclusion": "The image shows four objects on a flat surface. Each object casts a shadow on the ground. The objects are cylindrical, rectangular, triangular, and a piece of stone, with shadows labeled as A, B, C, and D, respectively.",

    "step_type": "image description",
    "conclusion": "The image contains several objects: a cylindrical object, a rectangular object, a triangular object, and a piece of stone. Each object casts a distinct shadow on the ground labeled A, B, C, and D.",

    "conclusion": "When the light source moves backward, the light rays become more concentrated, impacting both the position and size of the shadows.",

  },
  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "As the light source moves backward, the angle of incidence increases, leading to shadows that move toward the light source. This results in shadows that appear closer to the position of the objects.",
    "relevant": "Yes"
  },
  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "With the light source further away, the light rays spread out, increasing the size of the shadows. This is because a more concentrated light source creates smaller shadows, while a more diffused source creates larger shadows.",
    "relevant": "Yes"
  },
  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "Both the position and size of each shadow (A, B, C, D) will change. They will appear closer to their respective objects (since the shadows will shift toward the light) and larger in size due to the increased angle of incidence.",
    "relevant": "Yes"
  },
  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "When the light source moves backward above the objects, the shadows A, B, C, and D will change both in position and size. They will appear closer to their respective objects as the shadows shift towards the light source. Additionally, the shadows will become larger in size because the light source is further away. This phenomenon is caused by the increased angle of incidence of the light rays on the objects and the spreading of light rays as the light source moves backward.",
