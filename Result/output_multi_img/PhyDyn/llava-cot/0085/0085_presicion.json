    "premise": "When the light source moves backward, the light rays become more concentrated.",

    "premise": "When the light source moves backward, the light rays become more concentrated.",
    "conclusion": "With the light source further away, the light rays spread out, increasing the size of the shadows. This is because a more concentrated light source creates smaller shadows, while a more diffused source creates larger shadows.",

    "premise": "Both the position and size of each shadow (A, B, C, D) will change.",

    "premise": "When the light source moves backward above the objects, the shadows A, B, C, and D will change both in position and size.",
    "conclusion": "They will appear closer to their respective objects as the shadows shift towards the light source. Additionally, the shadows will become larger in size because the light source is further away. This phenomenon is caused by the increased angle of incidence of the light rays on the objects and the spreading of light rays as the light source moves backward.",
