    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "The size of the shadows will depend on the angle of the light source relative to the objects. If the light source is directly above the objects, the shadows will be smaller and more concentrated. If the light source is at an angle, the shadows will be elongated and larger.",

    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "The shapes of the shadows will change based on the orientation of the objects and the direction of the light.
