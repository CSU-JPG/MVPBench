    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "Moving the light source forward typically means that the light rays become more perpendicular to the objects.",

  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "As the light source moves forward, the shadows will shift closer to the objects because the light rays are now coming from a position that is more directly above, reducing the horizontal distance the shadow is cast.",
    "relevant": "Yes"
  },
  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "The size of the shadows will generally decrease as the light source moves forward because the light rays are more vertical, resulting in a smaller projection of the object's shape on the ground.",
