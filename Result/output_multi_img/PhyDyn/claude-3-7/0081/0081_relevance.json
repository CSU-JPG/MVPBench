    "conclusion": "There are four objects on a stone/concrete surface: an egg or partially colored spherical object (top left), a red apple (top right), a baseball (bottom left), and a microphone (bottom right). Each object casts a shadow on the ground.",

    "step_type": "background information",
    "conclusion": "Basic principles of shadow behavior: 1) Shadows move in the opposite direction from the light source, 2) Shadow size changes based on the object's distance from the surface and the angle of the light, 3) Shadow sharpness depends on how direct/diffuse the light source is.",

  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "When the light source moves to the right, all shadows will move leftward (opposite to the light's rightward movement) and become more directly beneath their objects.",

  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "When the light source moves to the right, shadow sizes will initially decrease as the light approaches being directly overhead, and as the light continues moving right, shadows will elongate to the left.",

    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "For the egg/spherical object (A): The current shadow is slightly to the right. After the light source moves, the shadow will move left and could become shorter initially, then elongate to the left.",

    "conclusion": "For the microphone (D): The current shadow is slightly to the right. After the light source moves, the shadow will move left and could become shorter initially, then elongate to the left. The microphone's more complex shape may produce a more interesting shadow transformation than the more spherical objects.",
    "relevant": "Yes"

  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "Final answer: When the light source moves to the right, above the objects: 1) All shadows (A, B, C, and D) will move left (opposite to the light's movement), 2) Shadow sizes will initially decrease as the light approaches being directly overhead, 3) As the light continues moving right, shadows will elongate to the left, 4) The shape of each shadow may change slightly due to the different geometries of the objects, with the microphone likely showing the most complex shadow transformation.",
