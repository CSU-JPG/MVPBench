    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "The ball fell largely through the gap between the yellow blocks, with any slight contact causing minor deflection, and its momentum was insufficient to significantly displace the blocks. The ball came to rest due to the table surface stopping its vertical motion.",
