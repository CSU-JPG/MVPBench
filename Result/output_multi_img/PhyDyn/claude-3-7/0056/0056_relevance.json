    "conclusion": "When objects A and B (cloth materials) move through the air and are placed down at the location of objects C, D, E, F (rigid blocks), gravity will cause A and B to fall onto and make contact with C, D, E, and F. The cloth objects will deform and drape over the rigid blocks, conforming to their shapes. This creates a draped effect where the cloth follows the contours of the blocks underneath, with excess fabric hanging down along the sides of the blocks.",
