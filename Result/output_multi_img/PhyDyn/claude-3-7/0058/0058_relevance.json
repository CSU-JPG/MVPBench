    "conclusion": "When objects A and B (flexible sheets) move through the air and are placed down at the location of objects C, D, E, F (rigid blocks), gravity will cause the sheets to deform and drape over the blocks, adapting their shape to the underlying blocks and creating folds and contours.",
