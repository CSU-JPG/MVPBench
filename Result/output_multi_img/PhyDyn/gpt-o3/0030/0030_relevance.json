    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "On first impact, the car strikes the blue-pink marble, which is round and offers little resistance; the marble is pushed slightly leftward and downward, while the car keeps most of its speed.",

  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "A fraction of a second later, the carâ€™s right front corner hits the red cube. That cube is light but has a flat face, so the contact produces a sideways reaction force that deflects the car toward the upper-left.",
    "relevant": "Yes"
  },
  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "The deflected car immediately bumps the larger purple cube. Because that cube lies almost directly ahead after the deflection and is heavier, the collision robs the car of most of its remaining kinetic energy and turns the car further to the left.",
    "relevant": "Yes"
  },
  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "With its speed now low, the car rolls only a short extra distance before coming to rest against the yellow cube, which wedges it and finally stops it.",

  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "A will end up essentially motionless just left of the yellow cube, nestled between the yellow cube and the red cube.",
