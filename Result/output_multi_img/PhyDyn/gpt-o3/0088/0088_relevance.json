    "conclusion": "When the light source shifts to the right (keeping roughly the same height), every shadow cast on the ground slides leftward (opposite the lightâ€™s motion), and shadows lengthen or shorten depending on whether the light moves closer or farther in the horizontal sense to each object.",

  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "Shadow A (from the birdcage) moves leftward and a little rearward; its outline remains much the same shape but becomes slightly longer because the effective horizontal distance from light to object increases.",

  },
  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "Shadow B (from the glass/transparent part) shifts left even more noticeably than A, because the object is farther right to begin with. The thin 'handle' portion also lengthens, so the whole shadow looks slightly larger.",

  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "Shadow C (from the drumstick) likewise slides left. Because the drumstick sits lower, the relative change in light-to-object angle is less dramatic, so the size grows only modestly compared with A and B.",
