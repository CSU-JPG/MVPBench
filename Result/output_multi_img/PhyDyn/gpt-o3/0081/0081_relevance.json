  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "Shadow A (egg) grows slightly in size because the light is farther sideways from the egg’s vertical line, lengthening the projection distance.",

    "conclusion": "Shadow B (apple) moves to the left on the ground, drifting more than shadow A because the apple is higher above the ground.",
    "relevant": "Yes"
  },
  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "Shadow B (apple) enlarges slightly more than shadow A due to greater sideways displacement increasing shadow length.",

  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "Shadow C (baseball) shifts left by about the same amount as shadow B because the baseball is at a comparable height.",

  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",

    "relevant": "Yes"
  },
  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "Shadow D (microphone) lengthens the most, especially its shaft, because lateral shifts in the lamp exaggerate the length of a long object tilted toward the ground.",

  },
  {
    "step_type": "background information",
    "conclusion": "When the light source moves to the right, rays reach objects from a steeper rightward angle, causing shadows to slide left.",
    "relevant": "Yes"
  },
  {
    "step_type": "background information",
    "conclusion": "The higher an object’s point above the ground or the farther a piece extends sideways from the point touching the ray, the more a small horizontal lamp shift magnifies the horizontal reach of its shadow.",
