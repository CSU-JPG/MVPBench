  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "The column experiences a sideways impulse but, because the bottom orange block offers a broader base and friction with the cloth, the stack does not topple; it rocks and settles back almost upright.",

  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "Car A plows through the blue and green cubes, scattering them forward and left, then glances off the yellow column, is deflected, and finally stops just to the right of the column while the column itself remains upright.",
