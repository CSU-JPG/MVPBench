    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "premise": "Because the light gets closer to vertical, the shadows also shorten: the higher the light, the smaller the silhouette footprint on the floor.",

  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "premise": "The change in shadow size is proportional to how tall each object is. Taller objects (such as A and B) still keep slightly larger shadows than shorter ones (C and D), but every shadow’s overall length decreases compared with its original length.",
