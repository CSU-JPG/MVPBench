    "step_type": "background information",
    "conclusion": "The problem involves analyzing how the shadows (A, B, C, and D) of four objects change in position and size when the light source moves downward.",

    "step_type": "image description",
    "conclusion": "The image shows four objects above slabs, each casting a shadow (A, B, C, and D) on the ground. The objects include a glove, a dress-form, a roll of tape, and another object.",
    "relevant": "Yes"
  },
  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "When the light source moves downward, all four shadows (A, B, C, and D) get longer and move farther from the bases of the corresponding objects.",
    "relevant": "Yes"
  },
  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "The direction in which each shadow slides on the floor stays the same, determined by the horizontal direction from the lamp to the object, but the displacement increases.",
    "relevant": "Yes"
  },
  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "Because the lamp is lower, the rays strike each object at a shallower angle, causing the topmost points of the objects to project much farther out, enlarging every shadow.",
    "relevant": "Yes"
  },
  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "The amount of enlargement of the shadows is roughly proportional to the objectâ€™s height: C (shadow of the tall dress-form) grows the most, A (shadow of the small glove) grows the least, with B and D in between.",
    "relevant": "Yes"
