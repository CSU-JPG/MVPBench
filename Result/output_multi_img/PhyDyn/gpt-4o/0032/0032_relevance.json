    "step_type": "logical inference",

  },
  {

    "conclusion": "After the collision, the yellow and orange stacked blocks remain in their original position due to their stability, the green and blue blocks are scattered around the car due to the force of impact, and the red blocks and the single yellow block in the background remain stationary as they are not in the path of the car.",
