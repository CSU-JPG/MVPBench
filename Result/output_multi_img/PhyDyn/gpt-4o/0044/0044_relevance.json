  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "After colliding with the purple block, A's trajectory may slightly change due to deflection, but the change in direction is likely minimal because the purple block is small and lightweight compared to A's momentum.",
    "relevant": "Yes"

  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",

  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
