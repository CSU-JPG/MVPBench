    "conclusion": "The images show two setups with objects labeled A, B, C, D, E, and F. Objects A and B are spherical and placed above fabric-like surfaces. Objects C, D, E, and F are cuboidal and positioned on the fabric surfaces.",
    "relevant": "Yes"
  },
  {
    "step_type": "background information",
    "conclusion": "Objects A and B are moving through the air and placed down onto the fabric surfaces where objects C, D, E, and F are already present. The interaction between A, B, and the fabric surfaces due to gravity is the focus of the question.",
    "relevant": "Yes"
  },
  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "When objects A and B are placed on the fabric surfaces, gravity causes them to exert a downward force, deforming the fabric surfaces and creating depressions or indentations.",

  },
  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "The deformation of the fabric surfaces will cause objects C, D, E, and F to shift or move toward the depressions created by A and B.",

  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "The fabric surfaces mimic the behavior of spacetime in physics, where massive objects create curves or dents that influence the movement of nearby objects.",
    "relevant": "Yes"
  },
  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "Objects C, D, E, and F are not fixed in place, so they will respond to the deformation by sliding or rolling toward the depressions created by A and B.",
    "relevant": "Yes"
  },
  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "When objects A and B are placed down onto the fabric surfaces, they will create depressions due to gravity, and objects C, D, E, and F will move toward the depressions, resulting in a clustering effect around the locations of A and B.",
