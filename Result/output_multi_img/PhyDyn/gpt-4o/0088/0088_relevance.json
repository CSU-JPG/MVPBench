    "conclusion": "In the first image, there are three shadows labeled A, B, and C cast by three objects: a birdcage, a cup, and a drumstick. The light source is positioned to the left of these objects, causing the shadows to extend to the right.",

  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "As the light source moves to the right, the shadows will shift to the left because the light is now coming from a different angle, causing the shadows to be cast in the opposite direction.",

    "conclusion": "The size of the shadow depends on the distance between the light source and the object. As the light source moves horizontally, the distance to each object may change slightly, but the primary effect is the change in angle.",
