    "conclusion": "In the first image, the light source is positioned such that the shadows are cast towards the left side of the objects. The shadows are relatively elongated, indicating that the light source is at an angle to the objects.",

    "step_type": "logical inference",

    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "As the light source moves closer to being directly overhead, the shadows become shorter because the light rays are more perpendicular to the ground, reducing the length of the shadows.",

    "relevant": "Yes"

  {
    "step_type": "image description",
    "conclusion": "In the second image, the shadows are noticeably shorter and more directly beneath the objects compared to the first image. The shadows have moved from being cast to the left to being more centered, indicating that the light source is more directly above the objects.",

  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "When the light source moves forward above the objects, the shadows A, B, C, and D become shorter and move closer to the objects, becoming more centered beneath them. This is due to the light rays becoming more perpendicular to the ground as the light source approaches a position directly above the objects.",
