The magnitude of the air resistance experienced by the basketball during its motion is λ times the magnitude of the gravitational force acting on the basketball (where λ is a constant and 0<λ<(H-h)/(H+h)). The ratio of the post-collision velocity to the pre-collision velocity is the same for each collision with the ground. The magnitude of the gravitational acceleration is g.",
