A beam of light parallel to the central symmetry axis OO' is incident on the outer surface of this hemisphere. A circular light-blocking plate must be placed above the shell to ensure no light exits from the inner surface.",

    "premise": "The critical angle C for total internal reflection is given by the formula: sin C = 1/n. Substituting the given refractive index n = √2, we get sin C = 1/√2 = √2/2.",

    "premise": "When the beam enters the glass shell, Snell's Law applies: n1 sin θi = n2 sin θt. For normal incidence θi = 0°, so sin α = n sin C. Substituting α with C since C is critical, we get sin α = √2 * √2/2 = 1.",
