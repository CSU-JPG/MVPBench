A charged particle with mass m and charge q (q>0) enters the electric field at point A with different velocities in the plane of the paper, and the direction of the velocity is perpendicular to the electric field. It is known that a particle entering the field with zero initial velocity exits the field at point C on the circumference with a speed v0. The angle between AC and AB is θ=60°. The particle is only subjected to the electric force during its motion.",
