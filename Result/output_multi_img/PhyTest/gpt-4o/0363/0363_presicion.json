    "conclusion": "The negatively charged particles enter the collector with an initial horizontal velocity v_0. As they move through the collector, they experience a vertical force due to the uniform electric field E between the plates. This force causes vertical acceleration a, which deflects the particles toward the positively charged plate. The particles are just completely collected when they travel the horizontal distance L (the length of the plates) and are deflected vertically by a distance d (the spacing between the plates).",
