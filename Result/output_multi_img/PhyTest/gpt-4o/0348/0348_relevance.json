    "conclusion": "For an ideal gas undergoing an isothermal process, the relationship between pressure (P), volume (V), and temperature (T) is given by the ideal gas law: PV = nRT, where n is the number of moles and R is the ideal gas constant.",
    "relevant": "Yes"

  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "Since the temperature is constant, PV remains constant during the isothermal process.",

    "conclusion": "In the P-V diagram, as the gas transitions from state C to state D, the volume increases while the pressure decreases.",

    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "As the pressure decreases, the frequency of molecular collisions with the wall decreases.",
