    "conclusion": "The system consists of four identical wooden blocks (A, B, C, and D) placed on a smooth horizontal surface. Blocks B and C are connected by a light spring, which is within its elastic limit. A horizontal pulling force F is applied to block B, causing all four blocks to accelerate together with the same acceleration a.",

  {
    "step_type": "background information",
    "conclusion": "Since the surface is smooth, there is no kinetic friction. However, static friction forces act between the blocks to ensure they move together with the same acceleration.",

    "conclusion": "The total mass of the system is 4m, where m is the mass of each block. The pulling force F causes all blocks to accelerate together with the same acceleration a. Using Newton's second law: F = (4m)a",
