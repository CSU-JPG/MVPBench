  },
  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "Since 1/v = constant for all points on the line, the velocity remains constant. This indicates that the particle is moving with a constant speed.",
    "relevant": "Yes"
  },
  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "Since the velocity is constant, there is no change in velocity, which means there is no acceleration. The displacement x increases linearly with time, indicating uniform motion.",
