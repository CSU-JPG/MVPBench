    "conclusion": "In an adiabatic process, the gas does not exchange heat with its surroundings, so the internal energy of the gas remains constant. The volume remains constant, and the pressure increases.",

    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "Since the gas does not exchange heat with its surroundings in an adiabatic process, the heat absorbed by the gas is equal to the heat released in an isochoric process.",
