  },
  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "Since the angle of incidence is 45 degrees, the angle of refraction is also 45 degrees, making triangle ONS an isosceles right triangle with angle ONS = 90 degrees.",
    "relevant": "Yes"

    "relevant": "Yes"
  },
  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "Using the properties of the triangle, the side opposite the 30-degree angle is equal to the side opposite the 45-degree angle, which is (1/sqrt(2)) * 30 = 15.",
