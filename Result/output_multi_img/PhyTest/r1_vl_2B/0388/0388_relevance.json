The forces involved include the frictional force between the block and the plank, the gravitational force, and the applied forces by the two individuals.",

    "conclusion": "The plank of length 0.60 m and mass 0.40 kg is leaning against a smooth vertical wall. A small block of mass 0.80 kg is at the lower right of the plank. A horizontal force F1 is applied to the left on the block, and a vertical force F2 is applied upward to pull the block.",

    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "The block is initially at rest, so the only force acting on it is the frictional force f due to the sliding friction between the block and the plank.",
