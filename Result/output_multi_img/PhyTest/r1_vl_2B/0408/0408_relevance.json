    "conclusion": "The image shows an equilateral triangular glass prism with two different visible monochromatic lights, labeled as 'a' and 'b,' entering from the air. Both light waves are incident at the same angle from the glass to the air.",

  {
    "step_type": "background information",
    "conclusion": "Total internal reflection occurs when light travels from a medium with a higher index of refraction to one with a lower index of refraction, and the angle of incidence must be greater than the critical angle for total internal reflection.",
