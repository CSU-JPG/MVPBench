    "conclusion": "The figure shows two regions of uniform magnetic fields on the left side of MN and the right side of PQ. The distance between MN and PQ is 2d. A thin insulating plate ab with a length of 4d is equidistant from MN and PQ. Point c is at the bottom left, and point f is horizontally aligned with the lower end b of the plate.",

    "step_type": "background information",
    "conclusion": "The particle is positively charged, injected from point c with velocity v0 at an angle of 45° to MN. The vertical component of velocity remains unchanged after collision with the insulating plate, while the horizontal component reverses direction but maintains its magnitude.",

    "conclusion": "The particle just leaves the magnetic field region on the left side of M for the first time at point f, which is at a distance of 2d from c and is on the same horizontal line as the lower end b of the plate.",

    "step_type": "logical inference",
