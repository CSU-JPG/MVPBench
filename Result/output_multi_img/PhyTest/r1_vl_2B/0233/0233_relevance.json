The magnetic field varies with time as B = 3 + 2t T, and the wire frame remains stationary from t = 0 to t = 5s. The task is to find the magnitude and direction of the frictional force at t = 2.5s.",

    "conclusion": "The magnetic force on the wire frame is given by F = B × l × v, where l is the length of the wire frame and v is its velocity. Since the wire frame remains stationary, v = 0, so the magnetic force is zero.",
