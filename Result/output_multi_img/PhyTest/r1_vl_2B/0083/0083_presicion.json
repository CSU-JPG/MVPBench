    "conclusion": "The problem involves analyzing the forces and moments in the self-locking state of a concealed lock on a classroom door. The lock consists of components such as a housing (A), frame (B), spring (C), latch (D), and lock groove (E). The spring has a stiffness coefficient k, and the latch has an inclination angle θ = 30°. The dynamic friction coefficient between the latch and the housing/lock groove is μ, and the maximum static friction force is given by F_fm = μF_N, where F_N is the normal force.",
