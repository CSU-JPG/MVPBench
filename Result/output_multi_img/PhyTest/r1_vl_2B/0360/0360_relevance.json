    "conclusion": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the behavior of ions in a magnetic field and how they are deflected by the electric field, using principles of circular motion and relationships between velocity, radius, and magnetic field strength.",

    "conclusion": "The system includes a velocity selector, magnetic analyzer, and deflection system. The velocity selector accelerates ions horizontally, the magnetic analyzer selects ions based on charge-to-mass ratio, and the deflection system deflects ions to a specific angle.",

The electric fields in the velocity selector and deflection system have a magnitude of E, directed vertically upwards and outward perpendicular to the plane of the paper, respectively.",
