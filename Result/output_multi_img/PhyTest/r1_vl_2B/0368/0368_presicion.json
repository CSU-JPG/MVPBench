    "conclusion": "ABCD is a vertically placed insulated thin tube, where the AB section is a 1/4 smooth circular arc tube with radius R, and the BCD section is a fixed horizontal smooth straight tube. The two tube sections are tangent to each other at point B. Points M, N, and B in the horizontal plane form an equilateral triangle with side length L. The line connecting MN passes through point C and is perpendicular to BCD. Two point charges with equal and opposite charges are fixed at points M and N, with charges +Q and -Q respectively. A small ball with mass m and charge +q has a diameter slightly smaller than the inner diameter of the tube. The small ball can be regarded as a point charge. It is released from rest at point A in the tube. The electrostatic constant is k, and the gravitational acceleration is g.",
