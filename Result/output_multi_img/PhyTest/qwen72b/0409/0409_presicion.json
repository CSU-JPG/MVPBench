After refraction, the ray continues to travel in the water and passes through point B. The problem asks if the point O1 is to the right of the intersection point O (where line AB meets the boundary).",

    "conclusion": "When light travels from air to water, it bends towards the normal due to Snell's law: n_air sin(θ_i) = n_water sin(θ_r) where θ_i is the angle of incidence in air, θ_r is the angle of refraction in water, n_air is the refractive index of air (approximately 1), and n_water is the refractive index of water (approximately 1.33).",
