    "conclusion": "The U-shaped tube has unequal diameters on the left and right sides. Tube A is open upward, and the cross-sectional area of the closed right tube B is 3 times that of tube A. The tube is filled with mercury, the atmospheric pressure is p0=76cmHg, and the ambient temperature is 27°C. The distance from the mercury surface in tube A to the opening is h1=24cm, and the mercury surface is Δh=4cm higher than that in tube B. The length of the air column in tube B is h2=12cm. To make the liquid levels in both tubes equal, a small piston is used to seal the open end, and the gas in tube A is heated while the temperature in tube B remains constant.",
