    "premise": "When the light rays enter the glass at the flat base, they refract according to Snell's Law: n_air sin(θ_air) = n_glass sin(θ_glass). Here, θ_air = π - γ, so sin(θ_air) = sin(π - γ) = sin(γ). Given that the refractive index ratio n_glass/n_air = 1/sin(γ).",
    "conclusion": "sin(θ_glass) = sin(γ) / sin(γ) = 1. Thus, θ_glass = π/2. This means the light rays bend perpendicular to the flat base and travel straight up towards the semicircular surface.",
