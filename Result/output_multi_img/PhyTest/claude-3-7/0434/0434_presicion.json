    "conclusion": "We have a car headlight with a parabolic reflector and a hemispherical lens. Light source is at focal point F of the parabola. Light is reflected by the parabola and enters the lens perpendicular to diameter MN. A light-blocking plate is installed below the symmetry axis. The lens has refractive index n = 4/3. We need to find the length of the transparent part where light enters the lens.",

    "conclusion": "When light rays originate from the focal point F of a parabola, they reflect off the parabolic surface and travel parallel to the axis of the parabola. This is a key property of parabolic reflectors.",

    "conclusion": "Based on the diagrams and the nature of the parabolic reflector, all light that passes above the blocking plate will reach the lens. This means the transparent part extends from N to M, covering the entire top half of the hemispherical surface.",
