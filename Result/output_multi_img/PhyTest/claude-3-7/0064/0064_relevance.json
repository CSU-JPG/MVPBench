    "conclusion": "The problem involves a circular wooden board with radius r floating on a liquid surface, with a point light source S located at depth H = √3r directly below the center O of the board. The liquid has refractive index n = √2, and the task is to find how far upward to move S so light is just not visible above the surface.",
