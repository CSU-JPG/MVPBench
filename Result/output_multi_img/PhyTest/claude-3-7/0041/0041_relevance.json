    "conclusion": "The velocity of an object at any time can be calculated as v = v₀ + ∫a(t)dt. Since both objects start from rest (v₀ = 0), the velocity at time t₁ is equal to the area under the acceleration-time graph from t = 0 to t = t₁.",

    "conclusion": "For Object B, the acceleration can be expressed as a_B(t) = (a_B(t₁)/t₁) × t, and the velocity at time t₁ is v_B(t₁) = (1/2) × t₁ × a_B(t₁), which is the area of the triangle from 0 to t₁.",
