    "conclusion": "The P-V diagram shows a Stirling cycle with four processes: A→B: Isothermal expansion (pressure decreases, volume increases, temperature constant), B→C: Isochoric cooling (pressure decreases, volume constant, temperature decreases), C→D: Isothermal compression (pressure increases, volume decreases, temperature constant), D→A: Isochoric heating (pressure increases, volume constant, temperature increases).",

  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "premise": "Yes, the speed distribution curve of the gas molecules changes during the D→A process. Since this is an isochoric heating process where temperature increases, the Maxwell-Boltzmann speed distribution shifts toward higher speeds, becomes broader, and its peak height decreases.",
