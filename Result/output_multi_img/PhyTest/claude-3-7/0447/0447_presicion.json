A laser beam containing both red and green light enters perpendicular to the diameter MN. Initially, the beam enters at point R/2 left of center O. As the beam shifts further left, only monochromatic light exits the curved surface. The angle between emitted light and incident direction is 30° for both colors. We need to find the refractive indices for both colors of light.",
