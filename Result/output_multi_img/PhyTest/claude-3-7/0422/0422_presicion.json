A beam containing red, green, and purple light hits the ball at an incident angle of 45°. The green light (B) is refracted so it's just tangent to the inner wall. We need to determine which color (red, green, or purple) has the smallest propagation speed in this material.",

    "conclusion": "Define outer radius of the ball = R, inner radius (hollow part) = r = R/2, incident angle i = 45°, speed of light in vacuum = c, speeds of red, green, and purple light in the material are v_r, v_g, and v_p respectively, refractive indices are n_r = c/v_r, n_g = c/v_g, and n_p = c/v_p.",

    "premise": "For a ray to be tangent to a circle from a point outside the circle, the ray must be perpendicular to the radius at the point of tangency. The distance from the center of the circle to the refracted ray must equal the radius of the inner circle (R/2).",
    "conclusion": "The distance can be calculated as R sin(r_g), where r_g is the angle of refraction. So we need: R sin(r_g) = R/2, which simplifies to sin(r_g) = 1/2, meaning r_g = 30°.",
