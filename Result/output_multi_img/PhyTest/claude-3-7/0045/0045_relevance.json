    "conclusion": "The graph shows 1/v (in s·m⁻¹) on the y-axis and x (in m) on the x-axis. The relationship appears to be linear with a positive slope, starting from the origin O and passing through points B and B'.",

    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "The reciprocal of velocity (1/v) gives the time taken to travel a unit distance. A larger value of 1/v means a smaller velocity.",

  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "The fact that 1/v is plotted directly (not |1/v|) suggests that v is positive throughout the motion. If v were negative, we would typically see discontinuities or negative values of 1/v.",
    "relevant": "Yes"
  },
  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "Since the velocity v is positive and the value of v is decreasing as x increases (because 1/v is increasing), the magnitude of velocity |v| is decreasing with increasing displacement.",

  },
  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "The particle is undergoing deceleration. As it moves along the positive x-axis, its velocity remains positive but decreases in magnitude, which means the particle is slowing down.",
