    "conclusion": "We have a dipole with two charges +q and -q, each with mass m. The charges are connected by a massless rod of length d. The dipole is in the XY-plane with its center of mass at origin. There's a uniform magnetic field B⃗ perpendicular to the XY-plane (pointing out of the page). Initial conditions: Dipole aligned with X-axis, Initial angular velocity ω₀, Center of mass velocity v⃗₀ = 0.",

    "conclusion": "The velocities of the two charges are determined by: v⃗₊ = v⃗ₒ + ω₀ × r⃗₊ = ω₀ × r⃗₊ (since v⃗₀ = 0) and v⃗₋ = v⃗ₒ + ω₀ × r⃗₋ = ω₀ × r⃗₋.",

    "premise": "The equation of motion for a rotating dipole in a magnetic field involves both translational and rotational dynamics.",
