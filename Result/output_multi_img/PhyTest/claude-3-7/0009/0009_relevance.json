    "conclusion": "Yes, it is correct to say that the particle undergoes linear motion with gradually decreasing acceleration from 1 to 2 seconds. The curved section of the v-t graph between t=1s and t=2s has a gradually decreasing negative slope, which means the particle is moving in a straight line while its deceleration is gradually decreasing (acceleration becoming less negative).",
