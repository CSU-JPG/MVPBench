    "conclusion": "A charged particle (mass m, charge q > 0) enters a uniform electric field at point A. The field exists in a cylindrical region with circular cross-section of radius R. If the particle enters with zero initial velocity, it exits at point C with speed v_0. The angle between AC and AB is θ = 60°. The particle's velocity is perpendicular to the electric field. Only electric force acts on the particle while in the field.",
