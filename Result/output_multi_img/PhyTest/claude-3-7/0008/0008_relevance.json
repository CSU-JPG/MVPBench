    "conclusion": "Possible scenarios include: (1) The particle starts at the reference position, moves away, returns to it, moves away again, and then returns again. (2) The particle starts elsewhere, reaches the reference position, leaves it, returns to it, leaves it again, and returns again.",
    "relevant": "Yes"

    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "For this to happen, the reference position must be chosen such that the net displacement from the starting point to that position equals the net displacement at two other points within the time interval.",
