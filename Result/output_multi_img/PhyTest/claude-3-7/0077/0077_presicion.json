The distance from the mercury surface in tube A to the opening is h₁ = 24 cm, and the mercury surface is Δh = 4 cm higher than that in tube B. The length of the air column in tube B is h₂ = 12 cm. Tube A is heated while tube B remains at constant temperature. Goal: Find temperature of gas in tube A when liquid levels equalize.",
