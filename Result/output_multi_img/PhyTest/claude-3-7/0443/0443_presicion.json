    "conclusion": "From the images and description: Light source S emits two monochromatic lights: A and B. On the water surface, we see two circular illuminated areas: A small inner circle illuminated by both monochromatic lights A and B (polychromatic) and a larger outer ring illuminated only by monochromatic light B. The refractive indices of water for these lights are: For light A: n₁ and For light B: n₂. We need to find the sine value of the refraction angle of monochromatic light B at the boundary of the small circle.",

  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "premise": "Both light rays A and B travel through water and hit the water-air interface. At a certain angle (critical angle), light undergoes total internal reflection. This critical angle depends on the refractive index.",
    "conclusion": "For the small inner circle, both lights A and B can exit the water surface, creating a polychromatic illumination. For the outer ring, only light B exits, meaning light A has already reached its critical angle.",

    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "premise": "At the boundary of the small circle, light A reaches its critical angle. When a light ray is at its critical angle, the refracted ray travels along the interface (refraction angle = 90°). Using Snell's law: n₁ × sin(θ₁) = 1 × sin(90°) = 1",

  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "premise": "At the boundary of the small circle, both lights A and B have the same incident angle θ₁ because they come from the same point source S and travel to the same point on the water surface.",
