A uniform magnetic field of magnitude B exists in the space, directed perpendicularly into the plane of the rails. The distance between AB and CD is l. The conductor rod MN has a mass of m and a resistance per unit length of r. The height difference between MN and BD is also l. The conductor rod MN is released from rest and reaches a constant speed before it arrives at BD. During its descent, the rod remains horizontal and maintains good contact with the rails. The resistance and friction of the rails are negligible, and the acceleration due to gravity is g.",
