    "conclusion": "A cylinder of height 2H and volume 2V is divided into two chambers by a diaphragm of mass m. Initially, both chambers have equal volume V, pressure p, and temperature T. The diaphragm rests on a ledge with a gasket that provides a tight seal. The piston at the bottom moves upward slowly. When the pressure difference becomes large enough, gas will leak between chambers. We need to find the volume V_0 of the lower chamber when leakage begins. Given: x = mgH/(pV).",
