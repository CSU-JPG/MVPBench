    "conclusion": "A semicircular glass brick with a radius R has its cross-section as shown in Figure. The critical angle for total internal reflection within the glass is γ (γ < π/2). Parallel rays of light strike the flat base of the glass brick at an angle π - γ relative to the horizontal plane of the base and parallel to the cross-section of the glass brick. After passing through the semicircular surface, some of the light (including that tangent to the curved surface) can pass directly through the base of the glass brick. Ignoring any light reflected internally off the inner surfaces of the semicircular glass brick, determine the width of the portion of the base through which light passes.",
