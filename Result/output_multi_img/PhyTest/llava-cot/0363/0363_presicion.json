    "conclusion": "The principle of a certain negative ion air purification is shown in the figure. A mixed airflow consisting of air and negatively charged dust particles (considered as small spheres) enters a collector composed of a pair of parallel metal plates. In the collector, the velocity v_{0} of the air and charged particles along the direction of the plates remains constant. Under the action of a uniform electric field, the charged particles hit the metal plates and are collected. It is known that the length of the metal plates is L and the spacing between the plates is d. The effects of gravity and inter-particle interactions are negligible. If air resistance is neglected, and all particles with mass m and charge -Î± are just completely collected, determine the voltage U_{1} between the two metal plates.",
