C is the midpoint of AB, and OO' is perpendicular to AB through point C. Monochromatic light beams a and b with different frequencies are incident perpendicularly onto the flat surface AB from air at points equidistant from point C. After refraction, both beams intersect at point P inside the glass brick.",

    "conclusion": "The image shows a hemispherical glass brick with its flat surface labeled AB, positioned horizontally. The center point C is marked as the midpoint of AB. Perpendicular to AB through C is line OO'. Two light beams, a and b, are incident perpendicularly onto the flat surface AB from air at points equidistant from C.

    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "premise": "Both beams a and b enter the glass brick perpendicularly, indicating they are subject to refraction as they pass from air into the glass. However, since they are incident at points equidistant from C and intersect at the same point P, their paths are symmetrical.",

  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "premise": "Due to the symmetry in the setup (both beams entering perpendicularly and intersecting at the same point), diffraction is more likely to occur at the edges of the glass, not at the point of refraction.",
    "conclusion": "Light beam b is not more likely to exhibit diffraction than light beam a.",
