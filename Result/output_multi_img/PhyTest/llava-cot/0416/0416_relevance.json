    "conclusion": "The image shows a hemispherical glass brick with its flat surface labeled AB, positioned horizontally. The center point C is marked as the midpoint of AB. Perpendicular to AB through C is line OO'. Two light beams, a and b, are incident perpendicularly onto the flat surface AB from air at points equidistant from C. Both beams intersect at point P inside the glass brick.",

    "conclusion": "Diffraction occurs when light encounters an obstacle or an edge, causing it to bend around the obstacle. Refraction occurs when light passes from one medium to another with a different optical density.",
    "relevant": "Yes"

  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "Both beams a and b enter the glass brick perpendicularly, indicating they are subject to refraction as they pass from air into the glass. Their paths are symmetrical.",

  },
  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "Due to the symmetry in the setup, the likelihood of diffraction at the interface AB is the same for both beams a and b. Diffraction is more likely to occur at the edges of the glass, not at the point of refraction.",

  {

    "conclusion": "Given the symmetry of the setup and the fact that both beams intersect at the same point, light beam b is not more likely to exhibit diffraction than light beam a.",
