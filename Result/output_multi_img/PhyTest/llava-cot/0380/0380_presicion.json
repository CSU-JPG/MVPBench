At the right end of the platform, there is a small ball Q with mass m and a negative charge -q. On the left side, there is an insulating ball P with mass M = 4m and no charge, moving horizontally with an initial velocity v_{0} = \\frac{m g}{q B} directly toward Q to the right, resulting in a head-on collision. During the collision, there is no mechanical energy loss, and no transfer of charge occurs. The height of the horizontal platform above the ground is h, the gravitational acceleration is g, and air resistance is negligible.",
