The magnetic field direction is into the page, with a magnetic flux density of B. A positively charged particle with a mass of m and charge of q, released from point S with an initial velocity of 0, is accelerated by M and then passes through N along a straight line (the dashed line parallel to the conductive plates) with a velocity v. Gravity is negligible. Another positively charged particle with a mass of 2m and charge of q, also released from point S with an initial velocity of 0, departs from N with a deviation of d from the dashed line in the figure.",
