    "conclusion": "An L-shaped skateboard A is initially at rest on a rough horizontal surface. A light spring with a spring constant k is fixed to the right end of the skateboard. The left end of the spring is connected to a small block B, and the spring is initially at its natural length. A small block C slides onto the skateboard from its leftmost end with an initial velocity v0. After traveling a distance of s0, it undergoes a perfectly inelastic collision with B, and then they move together to the right. After a certain period, the skateboard A also begins to move. The masses of A, B, and C are all m. The coefficient of kinetic friction between the skateboard and the small blocks, and between the skateboard and the ground, are both μ. The magnitude of gravitational acceleration is g. The maximum static friction is approximately equal to the sliding friction, and the spring remains within its elastic limit throughout.",
