    "conclusion": "Two parallel metal rails are on a horizontal surface, with a distance between them. The left-hand ends are connected to a resistor R. The system is placed in a uniform magnetic field with a magnetic induction intensity of magnitude B and the direction vertically downward. A conductor rod MN with a mass of m is placed on the rails. Under the action of a horizontal external force, it slides uniformly to the right along the rails at a speed of v. During the sliding process, it remains perpendicular to the rails and in good contact with them. The coefficient of kinetic friction between the conductor rod and the rails is μ, the resistance of the conductor rod is r, and the magnitude of the acceleration due to gravity is g. The resistance of the rails is negligible.",
