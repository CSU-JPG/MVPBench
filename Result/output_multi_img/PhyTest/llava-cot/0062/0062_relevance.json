    "conclusion": "A smooth insulating inclined plane is fixed on a horizontal ground, with the angle between the inclined plane and the horizontal plane being θ. One end of a light insulating thin wire is fixed at the top of the inclined plane, and the other end is attached to a charged small sphere A, with the wire parallel to the inclined plane. The mass of sphere A is m, and its charge is +q. To the right of sphere A, another small sphere B with an equal charge is fixed, with the centers of the two spheres at the same height and separated by a distance d. The electrostatic force constant is k, the gravitational acceleration is g, and the two charged spheres can be treated as point charges. Sphere A is stationary on the inclined plane, and the tension in the thin wire is 0. Find q/d.",
