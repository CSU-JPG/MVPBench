    "conclusion": "As shown in the figure, the left end of the horizontal experimental platform A is fixed, while the right end B is adjustable horizontally. The left end of the spring is fixed to the experimental platform, and the right end has a slider, which can be considered as a point mass with a mass of 2 kg, pressed against the spring (not connected to the spring). When the compression of the spring varies, the speed at which the slider is ejected also varies. The circular arc track is fixed to the ground and is tangent to a rough horizontal ground with a coefficient of kinetic friction of 0.4 at point D. When the AB segment is at its maximum length, the horizontal distance between points B and C is x_{BC}=0.9 m. The height of the experimental platform above the ground is h=0.53 m, the radius of the arc is R=0.4 m, and θ=37°. It is known that sin 37°=0.6 and cos 37°=0.8. The segment AB at the end of the track does not shorten. After compressing the spring, the slider is ejected, and the speed of the slider as it passes point B is v_{B}. Find the angle between the velocity and the horizontal direction when it lands at point C.",
