R3 is a variable resistor with an unknown resistance, and C is a capacitor with a capacitance of C=2×10^-6F. When the sliding contact P moves from the left end to the right end, the terminal voltage of the power supply varies with the current in the main circuit as shown in Figure 2, where points A and B correspond to the two endpoints of the variable resistor.",
