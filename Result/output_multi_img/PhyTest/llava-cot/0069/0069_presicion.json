The resistance of the lamp in the circuit is R1=6.0Ω, the fixed resistor R=2.0Ω, and the voltage between A and B is U=6.0V. The switch S was originally closed, and the circuit was in a steady state. At the moment t1=1.0×10−3s, the switch S was opened. The current I displayed by the current sensor before and after this moment, as a function of time t, is shown in Figure B.
