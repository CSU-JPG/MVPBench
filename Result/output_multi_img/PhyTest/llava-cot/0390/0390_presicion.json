To the right of BD, there exists a uniform electric field directed horizontally to the left, with a field strength of E=6×10^6V/m. An insulating small ball a with mass m=8g is released from rest at a certain position on the inclined rail PA and allowed to slide freely. Here, g=10m/s^2, sin53°=0.8, and cos53°=0.6.
