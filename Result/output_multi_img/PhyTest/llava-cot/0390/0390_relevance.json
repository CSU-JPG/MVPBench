The rail AB is tangent to the smooth semicircular track BCD with radius R=0.5m at point B. O is the center of the semicircle BCD, and B, O, D lie on the same vertical line. To the right of BD, there exists a uniform electric field directed horizontally to the left, with a field strength of E=6×10^6V/m. An insulating small ball a with mass m=8g is released from rest at a certain position on the inclined rail PA and allowed to slide freely. Here, g=10m/s², sin53°=0.8, and cos53°=0.6. If the small ball a can just fly out from point D, find the height h_a at which a is released.",
