    "conclusion": "A horizontal metal ring with a radius of r=0.2m is fixed. Two metal rods, each with a length of r and a resistance of R0, are placed along the diameter of the ring. One end of each rod is in good contact with the ring, and the other end is fixed to a conductive vertical rotating shaft OO′ passing through the center of the ring. The rods rotate uniformly with an angular velocity of ω=600 rad/s. A uniform magnetic field with a magnetic induction strength of B1 exists in the left half of the ring. The edge of the ring and the brushes in good contact with the rotating shaft are connected to parallel horizontal metal tracks with a distance of l1. A capacitor with a capacitance of C=0.09 F is connected between the tracks. The capacitor can be connected to terminals 1 and 2 via a single-pole double-throw switch S. On the left side of the capacitor is a region with a width of l1, a length of l2, and a uniform magnetic field with a magnetic induction strength of B2. A metal rod ab is placed perpendicularly to the track near the left edge within the magnetic field region. Outside the magnetic field region, there are insulated tracks with a distance of l1 smoothly connected to the metal tracks. A '[' shaped metal frame fcde is placed on the horizontal section of the insulated tracks. The length of rod ab and the width of the '[' shaped frame are both l1, and their masses are both m=0.01 kg. The lengths of de and cf are both l3=0.08 m. It is known that l1=0.25 m, l2=0.068 m, B1=B2=1 T, and the directions are both vertically upwards. The resistance of the rod ab and the cd side of the '[' shaped frame are both R=0.1 Ω. Other resistances are negligible. The tracks are smooth, and the rod ab is in good contact with the tracks and remains perpendicular to the tracks during its motion. Initially, the switch S is connected to terminal 1. After the capacitor is fully charged, S is switched from 1 to 2. The capacitor discharges, and the rod ab is ejected out of the magnetic field. The rod ab then sticks to the '[' shaped frame, forming a closed frame abcd. At this point, S is disconnected from 2. It is known that the center of mass of the frame abcd rises by 0.2 m on the inclined track before returning into the magnetic field.",
