    "conclusion": "In order to determine the exit velocity of a toy gun bullet, a group of students from our school took a ping-pong ball, made a small hole in it, and filled it with some modeling clay. They measured the masses of the ball and the bullet using a balance, which were M and m respectively. Then, they placed the ping-pong ball on the edge of a table, loaded and cocked the toy gun, and set it on the table, aiming horizontally at the hole in the ball. After pulling the trigger, the bullet entered the hole and was ejected horizontally along with the ball. The height of the table was h, and the horizontal distance from the landing point of the ping-pong ball to the edge of the table was s.",
