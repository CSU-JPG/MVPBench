    "conclusion": "In a three-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system, the positive direction of the x-axis is horizontally to the right, and the positive direction of the y-axis is vertically upward. A uniform magnetic field is introduced into the system. A current-carrying conductor rod cd with mass m=10g and length L=50cm is horizontally suspended by two insulating strings of equal length in the positive direction of the x-axis and remains stationary. The gravitational acceleration is g=10m/s². If the direction of the magnetic induction intensity is the same as the negative direction of the z-axis and its magnitude is B₁=1.0T, the tension in the thin wire is exactly zero. Determine the magnitude and direction of the current I₁ in cd.",

    "premise": "The conductor rod CD is suspended horizontally, implying it experiences no net horizontal force. The forces acting on the rod include gravitational force (mg) acting downward and tension (T) from the strings acting upward. Since the tension is zero, the gravitational force is balanced by the magnetic force.",
    "conclusion": "The magnetic force on the rod is given by F = I L B sinθ, where I is the current, L is the length of the rod, B is the magnetic induction intensity, and θ is the angle between the rod and the magnetic field. Here, θ = 90°, so sinθ = 1. The force balances the gravitational force mg, leading to the equation: I L B = m g",
