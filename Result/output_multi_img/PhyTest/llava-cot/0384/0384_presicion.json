    "conclusion": "In the first quadrant of a plane rectangular coordinate system, there is a uniform magnetic field perpendicular to the plane and directed into the paper, with a magnetic induction strength of B=5×10−3T. At a distance d=1.2m above the origin O, there is a particle source S that can uniformly emit negatively charged particles with a charge-to-mass ratio of q/m=2×106C/kg in all directions within the first quadrant. A sufficiently long particle collection device is placed on the positive x-axis. When particles collide with the collection device, they are immediately absorbed. The collection device can export the charge to maintain electrical neutrality. The interactions between particles and the influence of gravity are negligible. It is known that sin48.5∘=0.75.",
