    "conclusion": "A thermally conductive cylinder is suspended from the ceiling of an elevator by a light rope. Inside the cylinder, a piston encloses a certain mass of ideal gas. When the elevator is stationary, the distance from the piston to the bottom of the cylinder is L1 = 19 cm. The mass of the cylinder is M = 4.5 kg, the mass of the piston is m = 3 kg, the area of the piston is S = 30 cm^2, the atmospheric pressure is p0 = 1.0 × 10^5 Pa, the maximum tension the rope can withstand is F = 120 N, and the gravitational acceleration is g = 10 m/s^2. The piston can move up and down inside the cylinder without leaking gas, and the friction between the piston and the cylinder wall, as well as the thickness of the piston, are negligible. During the motion, the piston never detaches from the cylinder, the rope does not break, and the ambient temperature remains constant.",
