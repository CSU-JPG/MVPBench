    "conclusion": "In a television entertainment program, there is a two-person game involving pulling a plank, which tests the coordination between the two participants. As shown in the figure, a plank of length L = 0.60 m and mass M = 0.40 kg is leaning against a smooth vertical wall. At the lower right of the plank, there is a small block (which can be considered a point mass) of mass m = 0.80 kg. The coefficient of kinetic friction between the block and the plank is μ = 0.20, and the maximum static friction between the block and the plank is equal to the kinetic friction. Take g = 10 m/s². One person applies a horizontal constant force F₁ to the left on the block, while another person applies a vertical constant force F₂ upward to pull the block, causing the block to start moving upward from rest. To make the wooden board move upward, what condition must F₁ satisfy?",
