    "conclusion": "As shown in the figure, the lower end of the vertical light spring B is fixed on the horizontal surface, and the upper end is connected to A. Initially, A is at rest. The mass of A is m=2kg, and the spring constant of spring B is k1=200N/m. A thin rope passes over a fixed pulley to connect object A to another light spring C with a spring constant of k2. When spring C is in the horizontal position and not deformed, its right endpoint is at position a, and the light rope on the upper end of A is just vertically straight. When the right endpoint of spring C is slowly pulled horizontally to position b, the tension force of spring B on object A is exactly equal to the gravitational force of A. It is known that ab=60cm. During this process, the height that object A rises and the stiffness coefficient k2 of the light spring C are both considered.",
