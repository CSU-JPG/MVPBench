    "conclusion": "Figure (A) shows the schematic diagram of a small rotating-armature AC generator. Its rectangular coil rotates uniformly around the fixed axis $00^{\prime}$, which is perpendicular to the direction of the magnetic field, in a uniform magnetic field as shown in the figure. The number of turns of the coil is $m=100$, and its resistance is $r=10\\Omega$. The two ends of the coil are connected to the resistor $R$ via slip rings, where $R=90\\Omega$. The AC voltmeter connected in parallel with $R$ is an ideal meter. At time $t=0$, the plane of the coil is parallel to the direction of the magnetic field, and the magnetic flux $\\Phi$ through each turn of the coil varies sinusoidally with time $t$ as shown in Figure $(Z)$. (Take $\\pi=3.14$).",
