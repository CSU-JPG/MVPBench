    "conclusion": "The image shows a graph with volume (V) on the vertical axis and temperature (T) on the horizontal axis. There are three states labeled A, B, and C. The line segment AB is horizontal, indicating no change in volume. The line segment BC extends from B over the origin to C, indicating a change in volume. State A is at a temperature T0 and volume V0, with pressure pA = p0. The work done by the gas from state A to state B is given as 10 J.",
