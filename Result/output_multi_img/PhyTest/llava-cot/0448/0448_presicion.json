BC is the diameter of the semicircle material brick, O is the center of the circle, and the radius of the circle is R. The AB side of the right triangle ABC is horizontal, ∠A=30°, and a screen MN perpendicular to the horizontal plane is placed at point A, and a beam of red light is directed at the center O of the semicircular brick. It is known that the refractive index of the brick for red light is √3, the speed of red light moving in vacuum is C, and the angle between the incident direction and BC is 60°.",
