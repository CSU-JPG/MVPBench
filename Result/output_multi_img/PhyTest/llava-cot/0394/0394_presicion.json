    "conclusion": "This problem explores the van der Waals equation of state for real gases, focusing on water as an example. We will analyze deviations from ideal gas behavior due to finite molecular size and intermolecular forces, and derive relationships for critical parameters, liquid-gas equilibrium, and properties of each phase. One mole of water is considered throughout the problem. Express the van der Waals constants a and b in terms of T_c and P_c.",
