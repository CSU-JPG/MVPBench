    "conclusion": "As shown in figure (a), four points A, B, M, and N in the same vertical plane are all at a distance of sqrt(2)L from point O. O is the midpoint of the horizontal line connecting A and B. M and N are on the perpendicular bisector of the line connecting A and B. Two point charges, each with a charge of Q (Q>0), are fixed at points A and B, respectively. An x-axis is established with O as the origin, and vertically downwards as the positive direction. If the electric potential at infinity is taken as zero, the variation of electric potential phi along ON with respect to position x is shown in figure (b). A small ball S_1 with a charge of Q (Q>0) falls vertically from point M with a certain initial kinetic energy, and passes through point N after a certain period. The magnitude of its acceleration a during its motion in the ON segment varies with position x as shown in figure (c). In the figures, g is the magnitude of the gravitational acceleration, and k is the electrostatic constant. Determine the magnitude of the electric force experienced by the small ball S_1 at point M.",
