    "conclusion": "The fixed smooth circular track ACB has a radius of 0.8m. Point A is on the same horizontal line as the center O, and the bottom point B of the circular track is on the same vertical line as the center. Point C is 0.2m vertically above point B. A block is released from rest at point A on the track, slides past point B, and then enters a sufficiently long horizontal conveyor belt. The conveyor belt is driven by a motor in the direction shown in the figure. The kinetic energy loss at the junction between the track and the conveyor belt is negligible. The coefficient of kinetic friction between the block and the conveyor belt is 0.1, and g is taken as 10m/s².",
