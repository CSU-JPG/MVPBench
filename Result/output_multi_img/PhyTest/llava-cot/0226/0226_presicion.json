    "conclusion": "ABCD is a fixed horizontal smooth rectangular metal guide rail in a uniform magnetic field with magnetic induction intensity B, direction vertically downward. The distance between AB is L. Both ends are connected to resistors with resistance R. A conductor rod MN with mass m, length L, and negligible resistance is placed on the guide rail, forming a spring vibration system with a light spring. Initially, the spring is at its natural length, and the rod has an initial horizontal leftward velocity.",
