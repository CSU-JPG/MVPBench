    "conclusion": "Two cars, Car A and Car B, are traveling in the same direction on a straight highway. From t=0 to t=t1, their vt (velocity-time) graphs are as shown in the figure. Compare the average velocities of the two.",

    "conclusion": "The image shows two velocity-time graphs. Car A's graph is a straight line with a positive slope from v = 0 at t = 0 to v = v2 at t = t1. Car B's graph is a straight line with a negative slope from v = v1 at t = 0 to v = 0 at t = t1. The lines are parallel, indicating that both cars accelerate at the same rate but in opposite directions.",
