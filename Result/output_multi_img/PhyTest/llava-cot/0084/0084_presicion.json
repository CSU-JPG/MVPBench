    "conclusion": "The image shows three hemispherical bodies labeled A, B, and C. Bodies A and B are in contact with the ground and with each other. Body C is placed between A and B, with all bodies at rest. The gravitational force acts downward, and the frictional force acts horizontally. The normal force acts vertically.",

    "premise": "The COM for the two-body system (A and B) is given by: COM = (m_A r_A + m_B r_B) / (m_A + m_B). Substituting m_A = m, m_B = 2m, and using the symmetry of the hemispheres.",
