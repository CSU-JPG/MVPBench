    "conclusion": "In a vertical plane, a block $a$ of mass $m$ is initially at rest at point $A$ directly below the suspension point $O$. A conveyor belt MN, rotating counterclockwise with a velocity $v$, is coplanar with the horizontal tracks AB, CD, and FG. The lengths of AB, MN, and CD are all $l$. The radius of the circular arc thin pipe DE is $R$, and EF lies on the vertical diameter, with point $E$ at a height $H$. Initially, a block $b$, identical to block $a$, is suspended from point $O$ and pulled to the left to a height $h$ before being released from rest. The string remains taut, and when it reaches its lowest point, it undergoes an elastic head-on collision with block $a$. Given $m=2g$, $l=1m$, $R=0.4m$, $H=0.2m$, $v=2m/s$, and the coefficient of kinetic friction between the block and MN, CD is $\mu=0.5$. Tracks AB and pipe DE are frictionless. Block $a$ comes to rest without bouncing upon landing on FG. Neglect the gaps between $M$, $B$, $N$, $C$. CD is smoothly connected to DE. Treat the blocks as point masses, and let $g=10m/\mathrm{s}^{2}$. If $h=1.25m$, determine the magnitude of the velocity $v_{0}$ of block $a$ immediately after the collision with block $b$.",

A block $b$ is suspended from a point $O$ and pulled to the left to a height $h$. When released, block $b$ undergoes an elastic head-on collision with block $a$ at point $C$.
