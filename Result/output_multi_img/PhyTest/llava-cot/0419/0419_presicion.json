    "premise": "The angle of incidence for the red light is α = 60°. Using Snell's law, the angle of refraction β can be calculated.",
    "conclusion": "sin β = sin 60° / √3 = 1/2, therefore β = 30°.",

    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "premise": "The cross-section of the prism is an equilateral triangle, which implies that the internal angles are 60°. The angle of deviation is twice the angle of refraction.",
    "conclusion": "The angle between the emergent light and the incident light (angle of deviation) is 2 × 30° = 60°.",
