    "conclusion": "As shown in the figure, there are uniform magnetic fields on the left side of M N and the right side of P Q. The distance between M N and P Q is 2d, and the thin insulating plate a b with a length of 4d is equidistant from M N and P Q. A positively charged particle is injected into the magnetic field from point c with a velocity v_0 at an angle of 45° to M N. If the vertical component of the particle's velocity remains unchanged before and after the collision with the insulating plate, and the horizontal component of the velocity reverses direction while maintaining its magnitude. The magnetic field region is sufficiently long, the particle has a mass m and a charge q, and the gravitational force on the particle is negligible. If the particle just leaves the magnetic field region on the left side of M for the first time from point f, which is at a distance of 2d from c (and is on the same horizontal line as the lower end b of the a b plate), what is the magnitude of the magnetic induction B of the magnetic field at this moment?",
