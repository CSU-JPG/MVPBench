The cylinder is divided into two initially identical chambers by an insulating diaphragm of mass $m$. The diaphragm rests on a circular ledge and a gasket between them provides tight contact. Both chambers are filled with gaseous helium at pressure $p$ and temperature $T$. A force is applied to the piston, so that it moves upwards slowly. Let $x = \\frac{mgH}{pV}$.
