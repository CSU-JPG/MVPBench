    "conclusion": "A charged sphere with mass m and charge +q is attached to one end of an inextensible insulating thread. The other end of the thread is fixed at point O. The length of the thread is L. A uniform electric field is applied horizontally, and the sphere is at rest at point A, forming an angle of θ = 30° with the vertical direction. The acceleration due to gravity is g (sin37° = 0.6, cos37° = 0.8). If the sphere is pulled to point B, which is at the same height as point O, and released from rest, calculate the speed of the sphere when it passes through the lowest point C and the tension in the string at this point.",

    "premise": "At point A, the sphere is at rest, so the tension TA in the thread is given by: TA = m * g * (1/sin(30°)) = 2mg. This is because the thread is taut and supports the weight of the sphere at this angle.",
