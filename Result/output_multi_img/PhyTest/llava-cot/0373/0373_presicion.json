    "conclusion": "A basketball of mass $m$ is dropped from rest at a height $H$ above the ground. It undergoes an inelastic collision with the ground and rebounds to a maximum height $h$ above the ground. The magnitude of the air resistance experienced by the basketball during its motion is $\lambda$ times the magnitude of the gravitational force acting on the basketball (where $\lambda$ is a constant and $0<\lambda<\frac{H-h}{H+h}$). The ratio of the post-collision velocity to the pre-collision velocity is the same for each collision with the ground. The magnitude of the gravitational acceleration is $g$. Determine the ratio of the post-collision velocity to the pre-collision velocity of the basketball during its collision with the ground.",
