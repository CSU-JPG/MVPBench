The points are labeled A, B, C, and D, with horizontal segments connecting A to B and C to D, and vertical segments connecting B to C and D to A. The diagram includes pressure (p) and volume (V) axes, with lines indicating pressure levels p1 and p2, and volume levels V1 and V2. The temperature at State A is given as T0.",
