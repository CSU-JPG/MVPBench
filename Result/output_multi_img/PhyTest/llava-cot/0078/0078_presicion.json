    "conclusion": "As shown in the figure, there are two carts on a long straight horizontal track. Cart A is moving to the left with a speed of v1, and Cart B is moving to the right with a speed of v2. Cart A is equipped with a gun that fires a bullet horizontally every Δt0 time interval, and each bullet hits the target mounted on Cart B. Ignoring the gravity and air resistance of the bullets, the speed of each bullet relative to the ground remains constant at v0. Each bullet hits the target when the next bullet has already been fired. Assume that the speeds of the two carts are not affected by the firing of the bullets. The distance between two adjacent bullets in the air is s.",
