    "conclusion": "The image shows a smooth curved track connecting to a horizontal ground at point O. Block A with mass m starts at height h and slides down. At point O, it collides with stationary block B with mass 2m. After collision, A and B stick together and move onto inclined plane C with mass 3m.",
    "relevant": "Yes"

  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "Block A, with mass m, starts at height h and slides down the curved track to point O, gaining speed due to gravity.",
    "relevant": "Yes"

    "step_type": "logical inference",

  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "During the collision, momentum is conserved. The total momentum before the collision is the sum of the momenta of A and B. After the collision, the momentum is that of the combined mass.",
    "relevant": "Yes"

  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "Since A and B stick together after the collision, their kinetic energy at point O is converted into potential energy as they rise up the inclined plane C.",

    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "The difference between the initial and final kinetic energy of A and B at point O is converted into heat due to the inelastic nature of the collision.",

  },
  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "Given the masses are m, 2m, and 3m, and using conservation of momentum and energy, the heat generated can be calculated by finding the difference in kinetic energies before and after the collision.",
