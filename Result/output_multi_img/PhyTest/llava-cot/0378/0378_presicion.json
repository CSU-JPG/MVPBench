    "conclusion": "A fixed smooth curved track smoothly connects with a smooth horizontal ground at point O. A smooth inclined plane C with mass 3m is placed stationary on the ground. A small block A with mass m starts from rest at a height h and slides down the track. At point O, it collides with a stationary small block B with mass 2m. After the collision, A and B immediately stick together and move to the right (the collision time is extremely short), smoothly sliding onto the inclined plane and rising to a height less than the height of the inclined plane.",
