    "conclusion": "Consider the liquid flowing inside the tube. The liquid can be thought of as being composed of ions (positively and negatively charged particles). As the liquid moves, these ions experience a magnetic force due to the magnetic field. This force causes the ions to be separated, creating an electric field across the pipe.",
