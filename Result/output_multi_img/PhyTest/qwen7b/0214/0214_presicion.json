    "premise": "For a motor, the current drawn when it is running typically decreases compared to its no-load current because the motor has a higher resistance internally when it is rotating.",

    "conclusion": "Since the motor draws a smaller current when it is running, the power P when the switch is closed must be greater than or equal to 7.5 W but less than 15 W.",
