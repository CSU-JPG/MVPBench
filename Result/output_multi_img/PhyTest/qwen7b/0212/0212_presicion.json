    "premise": "When the switch S is open, the voltmeter reads 6V. This voltage represents the terminal voltage across the voltmeter, which includes both the electromotive force (E) of the battery and the internal resistance (r) of the battery.",
    "conclusion": "The terminal voltage V_term can be expressed as: V_term = E - I r where I is the current flowing through the circuit.",

    "premise": "Since there are two resistors in parallel (10Ω and 20Ω), we first calculate their equivalent resistance: 1/R_eq = 1/10Ω + 1/20Ω = 2/20Ω + 1/20Ω = 3/20Ω",

  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "premise": "If we denote the total current from the battery as I, then: I = V_term/R_eq = 6V/6.67Ω ≈ 0.90A",

  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",

    "conclusion": "Rearranging for r: 6V = E - 0.90A · r",
    "judgment": "Reasonable"
  },
  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "premise": "Since the terminal voltage is also given by E - Ir, we have: E - 0.90A · r = 6V",

    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "premise": "When the switch S is closed, the 10Ω resistor is removed from the circuit, leaving only the 20Ω resistor in series with the voltmeter.",

  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "premise": "The voltage across the voltmeter (between points a and b), which measures the voltage drop across the 20Ω resistor when the switch is closed, is: V' = I' · R_20Ω = (E/20Ω) · 20Ω = E",
    "conclusion": "V' = E",
    "judgment": "Reasonable"
  },
  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "premise": "Since the internal resistance r of the battery is negligible under normal conditions when calculating external voltages, the voltage V' will essentially be equal to the emf of the battery, E.",
    "conclusion": "Given that V_term ≈ 6V, and assuming the internal resistance r does not significantly change the terminal voltage under normal operating conditions, the voltage between points a and b when S is closed should be approximately: V' = E = 6V",
