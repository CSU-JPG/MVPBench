  },
  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "When the rod is not energized, the only forces acting on it are its weight mg and the tensions in the wires. Since the rod is in equilibrium, the total tension in the wires is 2T0, where T0 is the tension in each wire.",

    "conclusion": "When the rod is energized, it experiences a magnetic force due to the current I flowing through it, given by FB = BIL, which acts vertically downward.",

  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "Let the new tension in each wire be T. The total tension is now 2T, and the rod is still in equilibrium, so 2T = mg.",

  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",

  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "Substituting T = mg/8 into the equilibrium equation 2T = mg, we get 2(mg/8) = mg, which simplifies to mg/4 = mg. This is consistent with the given condition.",

    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "The magnetic force FB = BIL must be equal to the difference in the tension before and after the rod is energized. The initial total tension is 2T0 = mg, and the new total tension is 2T = mg, so the increase in tension is mg - (mg/2) = mg/2.",

    "step_type": "logical inference",
