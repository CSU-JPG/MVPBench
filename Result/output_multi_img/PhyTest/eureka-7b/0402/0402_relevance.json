    "conclusion": "The figure shows a right triangular prism with triangle ABC as the cross-section, where angle A = 90°, angle B = 60°, and angle C = 30°. A light beam starts from point D on side BC, reflects off point E on side AC, undergoes total internal reflection at point F on side AB, and exits. EG is perpendicular to AC and intersects BC at G. Point D is the midpoint of CG.",

    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "Since angle A = 90° and angle B = 60°, angle C = 30° by the angle sum property of a triangle.",
    "relevant": "Yes"

  {
    "step_type": "image description",
    "conclusion": "EG is perpendicular to AC, so angle AEG = 90°.",

    "conclusion": "Let AB = h and AC = x. Since angle B = 60° and BA is vertical, BF = (1/2)h and AF = (√3/2)h using trigonometric ratios.",

    "conclusion": "Since EG is perpendicular to AC and D is the midpoint of CG, let CG = 2y, then DG = y. Using similar triangles or trigonometry, the coordinates of D, E, and F can be determined.",

    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "The angle of incidence i1 is the angle between the incident ray and the normal at E. The angle of reflection r1 is the angle between the reflected ray and the normal at E. By the law of reflection, i1 = r1.",

    "conclusion": "The angle of incidence i2 is the angle between the incident ray and the normal at F. The angle of refraction r2 is the angle between the refracted ray and the normal at F. By the law of refraction (Snell's law), n1 sin i2 = n2 sin r2. Assuming n1 = n2, sin i2 = sin r2.",

  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "From the geometry and the properties of the triangle, the angle of deviation is the difference between the angle of incidence and the angle of emergence. By analyzing the angles in the triangle and using the properties of the reflections and refractions, the angle of deviation is calculated as 150°.",
