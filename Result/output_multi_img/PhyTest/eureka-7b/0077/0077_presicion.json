The cross-sectional area of tube B is 3 times that of tube A. The tube is filled with mercury, and the atmospheric pressure is given as p0 = 76 cmHg. The ambient temperature is 27°C. The distance from the mercury surface in tube A to the opening is h1 = 24 cm, and the mercury surface is Δh = 4 cm higher in tube A than in tube B. The length of the air column in tube B is h2 = 12 cm. The goal is to determine the temperature of the gas in tube A when the liquid levels in both tubes are equal.",
