Block P (mass m) collides elastically with block Q (mass 4m) on the inclined plane. Block Q is initially at rest, and block P has an initial velocity v₀. The coefficient of kinetic friction between Q and the inclined plane is tan θ, and the maximum static friction equals the sliding friction. There is no friction between P and the inclined plane, and no kinetic energy is lost in the collision between P and the bumper. Both blocks are point masses, and the inclined plane is sufficiently long to prevent P from colliding with Q again before Q's velocity reduces to zero. Gravitational acceleration is g.",
