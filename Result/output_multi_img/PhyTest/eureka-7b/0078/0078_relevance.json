  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "The problem states that the speed of each bullet relative to the ground remains constant at \\(v_0\\), so the relative motion of the bullet and the cart must adjust to maintain this constant speed.",

  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "Since the bullet hits the target on Cart B, the distance traveled by the bullet must equal the distance traveled by Cart B plus the initial distance between the carts.",

    "step_type": "logical inference",
