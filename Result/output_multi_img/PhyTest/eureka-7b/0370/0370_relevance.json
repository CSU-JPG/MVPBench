    "conclusion": "The circuit consists of a power supply with internal resistance (r), a fixed resistor R1 = 50 Ω, a fixed resistor R2, and a variable resistor R3. The voltage across the power supply is given by U = E - Ir.",

    "conclusion": "At point A, the voltage drop across R1 is V_R1 = I_A * R1 = 0.2 * 50 = 10 V. The voltage across R2 and R3 is U_R2+R3 = 4 - 10 = -6 V, which is not possible, indicating the configuration at point A is not valid.",
