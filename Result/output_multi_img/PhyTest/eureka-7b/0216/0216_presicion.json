    "conclusion": "In this case, the current is from b to a, so the magnetic force on the rod will be downward (opposite to the direction of the current).",

    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "premise": "When the current is I_1, the springs are just not stretched, which means the magnetic force is balanced by the weight of the rod.",
