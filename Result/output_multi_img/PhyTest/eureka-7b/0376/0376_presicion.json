    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "premise": "The particle moves in a straight line in the electric field, which means the electric force is balanced by the electric field. The electric force is F_E = qE and the magnetic force is F_B = qvB. Since the particle is moving in a straight line, the electric force and the magnetic force must be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction.",
    "conclusion": "Therefore, qE = qvB, which gives E = vB.",

  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "premise": "The radius of the circular path is given by R = mv/qB.",

  },
  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "premise": "The arc length is θR, where θ is the angle of the arc. Since the particle just fails to exit the magnetic field, the angle θ is such that the horizontal distance covered is 2L - R sin(θ/2).",
    "conclusion": "The particle must travel a distance of 2L in the horizontal direction, which is the sum of the horizontal component of the circular path and the distance covered in the vertical direction.",

  },
  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "premise": "Using the relationship R = mv/qB, we can substitute and solve for v.",
    "conclusion": "From the relationship R cos(θ/2) = 2L and R sin(θ/2) = L, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find R.",
    "judgment": "Reasonable"
  },
  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "premise": "Since tan(θ/2) = L/2L = 1/2, we have sin(θ/2) = 1/sqrt(5) and cos(θ/2) = 2/sqrt(5).",
    "conclusion": "Therefore, R cos(θ/2) = 2mv/qB * 2/sqrt(5) = 2L and R sin(θ/2) = 2mv/qB * 1/sqrt(5) = L.",

    "premise": "Solving these, we get 4mv/qB sqrt(5) = 2L and 2mv/qB sqrt(5) = L.",
    "conclusion": "From the second equation, 2mv/qB sqrt(5) = L, we get mv = qBL sqrt(5)/2.",
    "judgment": "Reasonable"
  },
  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "premise": "Substituting mv = qBL sqrt(5)/2 into the first equation, we get 4 * qBL sqrt(5)/2/qB sqrt(5) = 2L.",
    "conclusion": "This simplifies to 2L = 2L. This is consistent, so the velocity v is v = qBL/2m.",
