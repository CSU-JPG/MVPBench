    "conclusion": "We have two hemispheres, A and B, placed between two vertical walls. Hemisphere A has mass m, and hemisphere B has mass 2m. Hemisphere B is smooth, meaning there's no friction between it and hemisphere A. However, there's friction between hemisphere A and the left wall. The line connecting the centers of the two hemispheres makes a 30° angle with the horizontal direction towards A. The problem states that the two hemispheres just do not slide, which implies that they are in equilibrium, and the frictional force is at its maximum value.",
