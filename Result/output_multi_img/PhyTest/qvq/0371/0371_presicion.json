In the fourth quadrant, there's a uniform magnetic field pointing into the plane. A particle with mass m and positive charge +q is entering the magnetic field from the origin O at a 45-degree angle to the y-axis. It eventually reaches point P at (3L, L) in the electric field, and at that point, its velocity is v_0 directed along the positive x-axis.",
