A constant horizontal force F is applied to slider B to the right, and both sliders are on the verge of not sliding upwards. The coefficient of kinetic friction is 0.5, and the maximum static friction is equal to the kinetic friction. Sin 37° = 0.6, and the gravitational acceleration is g. We need to find the magnitude of the external force F.",

    "conclusion": "Both sliders are connected by a rope, so they'll move together if they do move. The force F is applied horizontally to B, and they're on the verge of sliding upwards, which means the net force acting on them is zero because they're about to move but haven't started yet.",
