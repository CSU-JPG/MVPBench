The right triangle is ABC, with angle at A being 30 degrees, and side AB is horizontal. There's a screen MN perpendicular to the horizontal plane at point A.",

    "conclusion": "A beam of red light is directed at the center O of the semicircular brick. The refractive index of the brick for red light is √3, and the speed of red light in vacuum is C. The angle between the incident direction and BC is 60 degrees.",

    "conclusion": "The light is directed at point O, the center of the semicircle. The semicircle has diameter BC, so O is the midpoint of BC. The angle between the incident direction and BC is 60 degrees.",

    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "conclusion": "Determining the angle of incidence: The angle between the incident ray and BC is 60 degrees. Since BC is horizontal and the tangent at O is vertical, the angle between the incident ray and the tangent at O is 90 - 60 = 30 degrees.",

    "conclusion": "Correcting the angle of incidence: The angle of incidence is the angle between the incident ray and the normal. The normal at O is vertical, so the angle of incidence i is 30 degrees.",
