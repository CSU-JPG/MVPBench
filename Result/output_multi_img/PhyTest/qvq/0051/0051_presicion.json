    "conclusion": "We have an L-shaped skateboard, labeled A, which is initially at rest on a rough horizontal surface. There's a light spring with spring constant k fixed to the right end of the skateboard. Connected to the left end of this spring is a small block B. Another small block C slides onto the skateboard from the leftmost end with an initial velocity v0. After traveling a distance s0, it collides perfectly inelastically with block B, meaning they stick together and move as one entity afterward.",
