    "conclusion": "We have two metal plates separated by a distance d, with a small hole in the upper plate. Oil droplets are sprayed through this hole and some acquire electric charges. There are two oil droplets, A and B, each with mass m_0, falling with a uniform velocity through a distance h_1 in time t. Then, a voltage U is applied across the plates, with the upper plate positive. After that, droplet A continues to fall at its original velocity, while droplet B starts moving upwards with a uniform velocity, rising through a distance h_2 (which is not equal to h_1) in the same time t. Eventually, they merge to form a new droplet that continues to move between the plates until it reaches a uniform velocity.",

    "conclusion": "We're given that the air resistance on a spherical oil droplet is f = k m^{1/3} v, where k is a proportionality constant, m is the mass, and v is the velocity. We're to find this constant k.",

  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "premise": "Before the voltage is applied, both droplets are falling with a uniform velocity, meaning the net force on them is zero. The forces acting on them are gravity, air resistance, and possibly electric force if they have a charge. Since they're falling uniformly, gravity and air resistance must be balanced.",
    "conclusion": "Before the voltage is applied, the net force on the droplets is zero, so gravity and air resistance are balanced.",

  {
    "step_type": "logical inference",
    "premise": "After the voltage is applied, droplet A continues to fall at its original velocity, suggesting that the electric force balances the change in air resistance or something like that. Droplet B, however, starts moving upwards with a uniform velocity, indicating that the electric force is now dominating in the upward direction.",
    "conclusion": "After the voltage is applied, droplet B experiences an upward force greater than the downward forces.",
