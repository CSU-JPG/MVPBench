    "conclusion": "The problem involves an electron being injected into a uniform electric field between two parallel metal plates, A and B, which carry opposite charges. The electron starts from point O with an initial velocity v₀ = 4 × 10⁶ m/s, moving along the central line perpendicular to the electric field. It exits the electric field at point C, where its velocity direction forms a 30° angle with the initial direction. The task is to find the kinetic energy of the electron at point C in joules.",

    "conclusion": "There are two parallel plates, one positively charged and one negatively charged, creating a uniform electric field between them. The electron is injected into this field perpendicular to the field lines, following a curved path due to the electric force acting on it. It enters at point O and exits at point C, where its velocity has a 30° angle with the initial direction.",

    "premise": "",
    "conclusion": "Since it's a uniform electric field, the force on the electron is constant and perpendicular to its initial velocity. This means the electron will experience uniform acceleration perpendicular to its initial motion, causing it to follow a curved path, likely a parabola.",

    "premise": "",
    "conclusion": "To find the kinetic energy at point C, the magnitude of the electron's velocity at that point is needed. Kinetic energy is (1/2)mv², so once v at point C is known, the mass of the electron can be plugged in to calculate the kinetic energy.",

    "conclusion": "The electron has an initial velocity v₀ in the horizontal direction (perpendicular to the electric field). The electric field is uniform and perpendicular to v₀, so the force on the electron is constant in the vertical direction (parallel to the electric field).",
