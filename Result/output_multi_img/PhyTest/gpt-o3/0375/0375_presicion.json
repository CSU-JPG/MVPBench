The left and right ends of the rails are connected to lamps L1 and L2 with specifications '3V, 3W' and '6V, 6W' respectively. A conductor rod ab with resistance r = 1 立 is placed on the rails and is perpendicular to them. A uniform magnetic field with magnetic induction B = 1 T passes vertically through the plane of the rails. When the conductor rod moves to the right at a constant speed under the action of an external force, lamp L1 just lights up normally.",
