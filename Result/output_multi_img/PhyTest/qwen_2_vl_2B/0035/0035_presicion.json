During such severe weather, two cars, Car A and Car B, were traveling in the same direction on a straight one-way road, with Car B in front and Car A behind. At a certain moment, the drivers of both cars simultaneously heard a siren warning of an accident ahead and started braking at the same time, but unfortunately, the two cars collided.",
