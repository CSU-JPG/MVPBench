The lock consists of a housing (A), a frame (B), a spring (C) with stiffness coefficient k, a latch (D) with inclination angle θ=30°, a lock groove (E), and other components. The dynamic friction coefficient between the latch and the housing/lock groove is μ, and the maximum static friction force is F_fm = μF_N, where F_N is the normal force.",
