    "conclusion": "Two metal rails are placed parallel to each other on the same horizontal plane, separated by a distance of l = 0.6 m. The left and right ends of the rails are connected to lamps L1 and L2 with specifications '3V, 3W' and '6V, 6W' respectively. A conductor rod ab with resistance r = 1 Ω is placed on the rails and is perpendicular to them. A uniform magnetic field with magnetic induction B = 1 T passes vertically through the plane of the rails. The conductor rod moves to the right at a constant speed under the action of an external force, and lamp L1 just lights up normally. The resistance of the rails is negligible. The task is to determine the actual power P2 of the lamp L2.",
