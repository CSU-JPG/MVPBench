    "conclusion": "The problem involves a negatively charged particle with mass m and charge q, injected along the central line SO of two metal plates in a uniform electric field. The particle enters a square region abcd with side length 2L, containing a uniform magnetic field B directed perpendicularly into the plane of the paper. The particle moves in a straight line and just fails to exit the magnetic field from side cd. Gravitational force is neglected.",

    "conclusion": "The square region abcd has side length 2L, and the magnetic field B is uniform and directed perpendicularly into the plane of the paper. The metal plates MN and PQ are parallel, with MN coinciding with the left half of side ad, and the left ends M and P lying on side ab. The length of the plates and the distance between them are both L. The particle is injected along the central line SO of the plates.",

    "premise": "The particle moves in a straight line between the plates and experiences both electric and magnetic forces.",
    "conclusion": "The Lorentz force due to the magnetic field is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the electric force, resulting in zero net force on the particle. The particle moves at a constant velocity in a straight line.",
