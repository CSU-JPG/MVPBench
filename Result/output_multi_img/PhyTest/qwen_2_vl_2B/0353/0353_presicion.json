    "conclusion": "A horizontal platform of height H=0.4m is placed on a level ground, on which a rough straight track AB with an inclination angle of θ=37°, a horizontal smooth straight track BC, a quarter-circular smooth thin circular pipe CD, and a semi-circular smooth track DEF are vertically placed, and they are smoothly connected. The radius of the pipe CD is r=0.1m with its center at point O1, and the radius of the track DEF is R=0.2m with its center at point O2. Points O1, D, O2, and F are all on the same horizontal line. A small slider starts from rest at point P on the track AB, which is at a height h above the platform, and slides down. It undergoes an elastic collision with a small ball of equal mass at rest on the track BC. After the collision, the small ball passes through the pipe CD and the track DEF, moving vertically downwards from point F and collides with a triangular prism G fixed on a straight rod directly below. After the collision, the ball's velocity direction is horizontal to the right, and its magnitude is the same as before the collision. Finally, it lands at point Q on the ground. The coefficient of kinetic friction between the slider and the track AB is μ=1/12, sin37°=0.6, and cos37°=0.8. If the ball can complete the entire motion process, the minimum value of h is 0.45m. If the small ball just barely passes the highest point E, and the position of the triangular prism G is adjustable vertically, calculate the maximum horizontal distance xmax between the landing point Q and point F.",
