When these lights reach the water surface, they form illuminated circular areas. The small circular area is illuminated by polychromatic light (a combination of Light A and Light B), while the large circular area is illuminated only by monochromatic Light B. The refractive indices for Light A and Light B are given as n_1 and n_2 respectively. We need to find the sine value of the refraction angle θ of Light B at the boundary of the small illuminated area.",
