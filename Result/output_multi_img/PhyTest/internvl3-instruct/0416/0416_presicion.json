    "conclusion": "Diffraction is the bending of light waves around the edges of an obstacle or aperture, spreading out as they pass. The extent of diffraction depends on the wavelength of the light and the size of the obstacle or aperture. Light with a longer wavelength (lower frequency) diffracts more than light with a shorter wavelength (higher frequency).",

    "conclusion": "The refractive index of a material determines how much light slows down and bends when entering the material. The refractive index is inversely proportional to the wavelength of light in the material. Therefore, light with a higher frequency (shorter wavelength) will have a higher refractive index and bend more than light with a lower frequency (longer wavelength).",
